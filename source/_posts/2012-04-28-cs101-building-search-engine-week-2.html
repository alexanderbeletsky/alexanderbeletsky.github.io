<p><small><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this blog post expresses some impressions and details of Udacity CS101 "Building a Search Engine" online course. If you are either currently participating it or plan to do so in nearest future, this blog post could be a spoiler. Even though, I'm trying to make it generic as possible and do not spoil important things.<br />
</small><br />
</p><p>This week I've concluded Unit 2 of <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">CS101 Building Search Engine</a> class. As a previous one it was very basic. We did went thought programming fundamentals on <code>if</code> statements, <code>while</code> loops, conditions and boolean operations. In contrast to Unit 1, I haven't got any really new information for me. All the information given very nicely, preparing listener to do some more serious stuff. <br />
</p><p>I think I started to get used to Python a little bit. Unfortunately I do not practice it much now, so I have to find simple project that I could accomplish in Python, besides the search engine. As always doing code katas is very nice for introduction to any new language, so I can do that. <br />
</p><p>Homework was simple enough, but again as last time I got one problem that made me think some extra time. This is "median search" issue. Say, you are given 3 numbers - (1,2,3). Median is the one between bigger and smaller number, in this case it's "2". In (9,3,6) it's "6" and in (7,8,7) it's "7". As a previous time I started with something I don't suppose to know, like lists and sorting. Solving this problem just with knowledge I got so far more problematic. So, I spent some time on that.. and was really happy than I found simple and nice solution for that. You should try to solve that, pretending you know only procedures and conditional operations.  <br />
</p><p>Now, I'm looking forward for Unit 3. It's still basic, but there we suppose to create some simple crawler. I hope it will be fun!<br />
