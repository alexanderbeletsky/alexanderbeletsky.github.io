<p>For those, who already forgot what the candidate is I'll do a small reminder :). This is an <a href="https://github.com/alexbeletsky/candidate">application</a> for Continues Deployment for .NET projects. I started the project at <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/06/candidatenet-application-i-made-on.html">Hackatone</a> that took place in summer 2011, in Kyiv. I liked the results I got there, so I didn't throw it away after the contest, but slowly progressed on that through last several months. <br />

</a><br />
<p>The goal of application is very simple. Provide you with easy to setup and use tool Continues Deployment. I'm still very confused now with all those terms - Continuous Deployment/Delivery/Production/Release.. but in general it is nothing more as next step of Continues Integration. Rebuild and retest the application and deploy it in case of successful results.<br />

<p>I'm building that in mind of my own needs, how I see it might work for my projects. My own projects are really simple ones, so the candidate is really simple now. Of cause, I would like to be as general as possible, to cover common needs. I'm pretty much sure it would be rewritten hundred of times to reach the level of mass adoption and I'm looking forward to that.<br />

<p>Yesterday, I reached very important milestone of candidate.net. It is now feature completed. I would like to stop on current functionality and show it to you. It would take some time to prepare website and instructions, but please stay tuned for official release of project!<br />

<p>By the way, I'm still looking for new name! It turns out that finding the good name, could be even harder than finding process running <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7666423/iis-7-5-with-process-idenity-set-to-user-has-wrong-userprofile">bugs</a>. I would be really happy if you do such early contribution proposing some nice name. Please do not hesitate and share your ideas just in comments.<br />
