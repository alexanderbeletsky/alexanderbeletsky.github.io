<p>
My weekly update is what is going on in my Reader:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/06/introducing-webmatrix.aspx">Introducing WebMatrix</a>. Next and very loud announcement by ScottGu. WebMatrix is something that .NET platform lacks for years. Now it brings the gaps between complexity of ASP.net application and current needs for rapid web development. It could be analog of <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> for Ruby on Rails developers. So, Web Matrix is a tiny package including simple IDE, IIS Express, SQL compact edition and number of templates. It believe it will be used by bloggers and small size web site holders.

<li>
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/07/07.html">Web Applications Stack Exchange now in beta</a>. Joel Spolsky did announce of Wep Applications product. Next product after a very popular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>. Like a StackOverflow it is done like QnA site, but maybe for more broader audience.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://5whys.com/blog/scrum-vs-kanban-attitudes.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+5whys+(5+Whys)">Scrum vs. Kanban attitudes</a>. Roy Osherove gives a link about comparing Scrum vs. Kanban. I'm quite new with Kanban and I didn't want to spend to much time to understand what it's all about, so I found this comparison interesting.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2010/07/05/software-calculus-the-missing-abstraction">Software Calculus - The Missing Abstraction</a>. A little bit geek philosophy from Object Mentor. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ASP_NET_MVC_WITH_EF.aspx">Architecture Guide: ASP.NET MVC Framework + N-tier + Entity Framework and Many More</a>. Good and comprehensive tutorial on ASP.NET MVC with Entity framework.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2010/07/04/what-a-difference-8-years-makes-in-code.aspx">What a Difference 8 Years Makes (In Code)</a>. Just a nice to look of how code is changing with time and technologies, by K. Scott Allen.
