  <p>
    It's been great weekend. It started Friday evening with Kiev ALT.NET
    <a
      href="http://blog.kievalt.net/post/17767271242/ncrunch-nancyfx-fubumvc-event"
      >meet-up</a
    >
    which been in idle for a while and everybody missed that. There was a three
    planned speeches: by <a href="http://twitter.com/_TLK">@_TKL</a> on
    Continuous Testing (NCrunch, MightyMoose), NancyFX framework by me and
    FubuMVC by <a href="http://twitter.com/skalinets">@skalinets</a>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I would not say I got great experience on Nancy so far. But I'm pretty
    exited on frameworks features and super-dupper-happy-path. Almost all
    knowledge I gathered thought hacking of
    <a href="https://github.com/alexbeletsky/Ideastrike">IdeaStrike</a>,
    listening to Herding Code
    <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=350">episode</a> and reading
    <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Documentation"
      >documentation</a
    >. But anyway, I believe it turns out to be good introductory presentation.
    <br />

    Right after my Nancy talk I moved to central train station, since I was
    about to visit
    <a href="http://www.ciklum.net/join/community/Ciklum-NET-Saturday-25-02/"
      >Ciklum .NET Saturday</a
    >
    in Dnepropetrovsk. .NET Saturday's is just great initiative by Ciklum
    company. I's free event, everybody welcome, content is usually nice. I
    highly recommend to follow their events. <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I had two talks there. First one about "Continuous Delivery" that I did on
    <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/01/agile-base-camp-2012.html"
      >Agile Base Camp 2012</a
    >. Besides of the talk I also did a quick and improvised demo of
    <a href="http://alexbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">Candidate</a>
    application. Even if I had some technical issues the demo went fine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Another one is for logging and tracking unhandled exceptions in ASP.NET /
    ASP.NET MVC application based on ELMAH. I showed some basics features as
    well easiness of ELMAH integration to ASP.NET MVC with
    <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH.MVC</a> NuGet package.
    It was very light and funny talk, especially discussing Troy Hunt's
    <a

      >ELMAH attack</a
    >. <br />

    <br />
  </p>

  <p>
    I also really much enjoyed
    <a href="http://samarskyy.blogspot.com/">Anton Samarskyy</a> talk on jQuery
    deffered objects and Vitaly Koval did great hacking session of WinRT.<br />
