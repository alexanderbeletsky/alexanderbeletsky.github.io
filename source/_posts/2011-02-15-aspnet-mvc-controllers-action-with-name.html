<div class='post'>

If you want to have action with name <code>View</code> in your controller, you will meet a small problem. Base class of any controller <code>Controller</code> already contains a method, with same name (and it is overloaded):
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
protected internal ViewResult View();
protected internal ViewResult View(IView view);
protected internal ViewResult View(object model);
protected internal ViewResult View(string viewName);
</pre>
<p>
So, you code like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
public ActionResult View(string url)
{
    // some action logic...

    return View();
}
</pre>
<p>
Won't complied, because you are adding method with same signature (name and parameters list). You have 2 options here: gave up to compiler and rename action, to something new like <code>ViewPost</code> or insist and try to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately C# have beautiful feature for doing this. It is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/435f1dw2.aspx">new Modifier</a>. It hides the member on base class and explicitly says, that now your method is substituting it. So, everything you need is basically this: 
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
new public ActionResult View(string url)
{
    // some action logic...

    return View();
}
</pre>
<p>
It will make application compliable and work as expected.
</p></div>
