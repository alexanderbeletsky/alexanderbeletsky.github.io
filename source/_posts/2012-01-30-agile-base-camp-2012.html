  <p>
    Past Saturday I was a part of big Ukrainian event
    <a href="http://agilebasecamp.org/">Agile Base Camp: From Idea to Product</a
    >. It's been organized by
    <a href="http://www.scrumguides.com/">ScrumGuides</a>, pioneers on Agile in
    Ukraine and organizers of famous
    <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/Agile">Agilee</a> series of
    conferences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The conference named "From Idea to Product" and focused on product
    development issues. There was 3 stages there: Main, XP, UX. Main is for more
    or less common topics as budgeting, motivation etc.. XP is practical stage
    for developers and UX for user experience engineers. The program of
    conference was really interesting, but I spend all my day on XP stage (no
    surprise).<br />

    There were great speeches by
    <a href="http://twitter.com/dmytromindra">Dmytro Mindra</a>,
    <a href="http://twitter.com/skaninets">Sergey Kalinets</a>. Probably most
    valuable for me were ones by
    <a href="http://twitter.com/vitaliystakhov">Vitaliy Stakhov</a> and
    <a href="http://twitter.com/_TLK">Anatoly Kolesnik</a>, Vitaliy shared
    Hypermedia concepts of RESTfull systems and that looks very promising.
    Anatoly did great NoSQL introduction that is very actual at the moment. I
    also enjoyed
    <a href="https://twitter.com/defimenko">Dmitry Efimenko</a> speech about
    testing in product company. He did it in quite tough style, so crowd was a
    little shocked and kept silence till the last words. I got some interesting
    points for myself. <br />

  <p>
    I did a talk about - Continues Delivery / Deployment / Production. This
    practical field is very interesting to me not only because I'm trying to
    <a

      >build a product</a
    >
    for that and I want to adapt for all project I work to. <br />

    15 donuts (a special cards that listeners give to speaker if they like the
    speech), so I was quite happy about. If you interested, here is my
