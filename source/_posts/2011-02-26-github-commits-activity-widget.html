  <p>
    The most important factor about each open source project is how much
    community is active around this project. It is good to understand the
    factor. One of the indicators of activity is of cause commits to repository.
    You probably want to demonstrate how much active your project is by placing
    some information on a web site.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having this idea on my mind I created <code>github.commits.widget</code>,
    small javascript that could be easily integrated to your website and show
    something like this:
  </p>
  <div
    id="github-commits"
    style="border: 1px solid grey; padding: 5px; list-style: none"
  ></div>
  <p>
    Note, it is not just html pasted.. but widget added to this blog post.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is really simple for that:
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: html">
&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;github.commits.widget-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    $(function () {
        $('#github-commits').githubInfoWidget(
      { user: 'alexbeletsky', repo: 'github.commits.widget', branch: 'master', last: 5 });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre
