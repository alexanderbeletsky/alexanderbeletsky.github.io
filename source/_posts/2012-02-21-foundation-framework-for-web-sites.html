<div class="post">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> framework is
    something I discovered by accident browsing through some github project
    pages. I really liked how one of the sites looked on my iPad. I was also
    pleased to see how HTML crafted, using clear names for classes and HTML5
    semantics. As it turned out, that site was using Foundation Framework by
    <a href="http://www.zurb.com/">Zurb</a> - design agency in San Francisco Bay
    area.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I checked out the
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/">documentation</a> and Foundation
    appears to be pretty solid framework for web applications prototyping and
    production. It contained everything needed:
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/grid.php">Grid Layouts</a>,
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/buttons.php">Buttons</a>,
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/forms.php">Forms</a> and
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/ui.php">UI</a>. And of cause, all
    of that is open source hosted on github.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    During my preparation of project page for
    <a href="http://alexbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">candidate</a> I decided
    to try it out. I was really happy of the experience. <br />
  </p>
  <h2>Object Oriented CSS</h2>
  <p>
    Have you heard of
    <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a>? Initially I
    thought that idea is almost non-sense, but I'm changing my opinion now. I
    think Foundation fully conforms to OOCSS style of development - each
    behavior or UI you want to apply to HTML element is done by applying of
    corresponding class. <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Great thing is that you see how it's done in framework and do same in your
    code as well. I remember the times I started to do HTML/CSS and I higly used
    #id's, applying the styles by element Id. The code was awful and styles
    applied on #id's were not re-usable at all, so if I needed the same
    margin/padding or text color I have to copy the section of CSS and move it
    into next <code>#some-id { ... }</code>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>With OOCSS you rely on classed. Here some example,<br /></p>
  <pre class="brush: html">
&lt;div class=&quot;container darker-grey light-border small-padding&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;row smaller-fonts&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre
  >
  <p>
    Look, no #id's - classes only. With classes I control: position, colors,
    borders and margin/paddings. This is really cool, since all of that classes
    are easy reusable in any part of page.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>Grid system</h2>
  <p>
    Grid systems is really cool concept and allows to develop much faster.
    Instead of writing own CSS that would position elements, you stick to Grid
    System. The classical grid system is probably
    <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a>. It's really great and blown my mind as
    I first time tried it, but currently it little outdated: 960px wide is small
    for modern monitor and it is not adaptive. Modern web design demands site
    looks great both on PC and Mobile devices, adapt it's content based on
    screen size.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Here is a quote of Foundation documentation.<br /></p>
  <blockquote>
    The grid is built around three key elements: containers, rows, and columns.
    Containers create base padding for the page; rows create a max-width and
    contain the columns; and columns create the final structure. Everything on
    your page that you don't give a specific structural style to should be
    within a container, row and column.<br />
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    You develop the layout based on planned number of row and columns that
    compose the row. Again, code is done in OOCSS way with clean classes names,
    so you write almost "plain" English in HTML.<br />
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: html">
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
      Eight columns
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;
      Four columns     
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre

  <p>
    After design is ready, you just open it on iPad and.. Surprise, it looks
    great there! Text and columns are adaptively fits the screen size. <br />
  </p>
  <h2>Buttons and Forms</h2>
  <p>
    Buttons and Forms are same important as Colors and Fonts in your web site.
    You can't get good site appearance if buttons and forms are ugly. I usually
    spend a lot of time on "beautifying" those, but still unhappy with results
    at the end of the day. With Foundation it's easier. You got nice styles from
    the box. <br />
  </p>
  <p>Forms:<br /></p>

  <p>
    Recently, I've
    <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/pull/313">submitted</a> green
    button style, so I hope it will be available soon.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>UI stuff</h2>
  <p>
    Besides those primary things you got nice bonus. That's different UI
    elements commonly used through different web sites. It includes: Alerts,
    Labels, Warnings, Tooltips, Tabs etc. <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For <a href="http://alexbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">candidate</a> site I
    successfully used Pagination UI element. <br />

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    Currently <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> from
    Twitter is obvious leader in that niche. But I really think Foundation will
    get it's place. Easy to use, great documentation
    <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation">repository</a> is very active,
    so we might expected further great features in Foundation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And by the way.. To payback Foundation, I got idea for small product:
    inspired by <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> I'm about to
    create bunch of "ready-to-use" Foundation themes, that you just download and
    start to use immediately. It will work great for people who are about to
    create one page product presentation or simple blog. Hope it will go fine
    and I release it soon.<br />
