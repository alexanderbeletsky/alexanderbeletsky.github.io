<p>As one of my favorite topics - tools that improve tests quality I would like to describe a <a href="http://site.typemock.com/test-lint">TestLint</a>. It is a rather new tool from famous TypeMock company, so as soon it has been announced I've immediately downloaded it.</p>
<p>
I've used it couple of weeks and want to share what I liked:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>It is lightweight, easy to install</li>
<li>It easily detects a empty test cases. In such case it shows a warning near the case</li>
<li>Documentation says that it is <a href="http://site.typemock.com/creating-a-test-lint-rule/">extendable</a> by custom rules, but I haven't tried it yes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What my initial feedback on it could be:
<ul>
<li>I would believe my tests are perfect, but "Empty" case if only one warning I saw from TestLint so far</li>
<li>Analysis is done on pre-build sources, so to get results you have to build you tests first</li>
<li>You can get analysis only by browsing a sources. It would be nice, if you can get all warnings in separate window</li>
<li>It would be nice to see all rules currently used in some UI</li>
<li>It would be nice if rules could be created not only by API but also through some interface</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, TestLint is free, it doesn't crash your Visual Studio, it helps you to do better job in some way - there are no reasons not to install it! I would recommend it and waiting for next versions with improvements.
