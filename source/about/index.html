      My name is Alexander Beletsky, I was born in Kiev, Ukraine, but currently live and work in Berlin, Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
		Through almost 15 years of professional experience, I worked on many projects, with a broad range of technologies. For the last years, my focus primarily on a web technological stack, utilizing JavaScript eco-system.
  </p>
  <p>
      I consider myself as a full-stack engineer, working on back-end and front-end and having fun on making products happen.
  </p>
  <p>
      My passion goes to technological startups, small teams, people who respect the craft and respect other people.
  </p>
  <p>
  I <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/12/likeastore-is-becoming-a-company.html">founded</a> one company back in 2013 and failed with it. Since when I work hard on my entrepreneur skills and try to learn as much as possible, to apply that knowledge and experience on my next venture.
