    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is exactly <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/03/likeastore-application-built-on.html">one year</a> as we started <a href="https://likeastore.com">Likeastore</a> project. It went through a different stages, from hack to side-project and finally transformed to real <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/12/likeastore-is-becoming-a-company.html">startup</a>.</p>

<p>The year, seems to be a huge period of time. It is, but I have to say it&rsquo;s only few last months (from the middle of December till today), we are fully dedicated to project. It&rsquo;s been great ride so far, so I wish to share some interesting moments.</p>

<!--More-->


<h2>What we started with</h2>

<p>Let me remind you, <a href="https://likeastore.com">Likeastore</a> is a web application that allow users to connect their social accounts and collect all their favorite items from them. We are 2 founders, me and <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">Dima</a> who committed themselves to build product that matters.</p>

<p>As founders we felt that &ldquo;likes&rdquo; are kind of new way of bookmarking. Then you favorite something on social network you do 2 things &ndash; you send appreciate to author content, as well as marking the content as interesting to you.</p>

<p>The problem that we try to solve. First, there are too many sources of information (social networks) where we spend time and receive content from, so tracking all social likes is extremely difficult. And second, it&rsquo;s very hard to find exact favorite item since social networks provide poor search functionality.</p>

<p>So, our initial hypothesis for application was &ndash; <em>people want to collect their likes in one place and be able to search them</em>.</p>

<h2>Where are we now</h2>

<p>After successful demonstration on hackathon, we&rsquo;ve reimplemented application from scratch and did first private beta in May 2013. It was pretty painful, since after 10 minutes of fly my inbox was full of error messages. But, general impression of people we spoken was positive. We&rsquo;ve crossed the line from hack to side project.</p>

<p>Our public beta released at July 2013. All major issues were solved, the infrastructure established and UI/UX of product were done. We were lucky enough to be featured by Codrops and after by SmashingMagazine twitter, which gave us first 500 beta users.</p>

<p>At the end of 2013 we&rsquo;ve dropped our full time jobs, joined business accelerator and totally focused on a product. I would say, that was the point then we crossed the next line, from side-project to startup.</p>

<p>We are at the full speed, full time, 2 people dedicated to Likeastore. And since then, we did major step forward. Let me share some of current statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>6.370 <strong>signups</strong> (+ ~4.000 from January till today)</li>
<li>2.700.000 <strong>likes collected</strong> (+ ~1.500.00 from January till today)</li>
<li>~200 <strong>active users</strong> (+185 from January till today)</li>
<li>~600 <strong>feedback emails received</strong></li>
<li>452 <strong>collections created</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>How does it feel like</h2>

<p>First of all, time flows 2x faster compare to anything I was involved before. You put yourself in a very constraint environment: lack of money, lack of time, not clear whats happens tomorrow. Multitasking is second name of startup, you don&rsquo;t have time to be focused on one task during the day.</p>

<p>Every day you feel ups and downs. The mood is changing constantly. You have growth and receive users feedback &ndash; it feels great. You talk to investors or mentors that find weaks and leaks of idea &ndash; it feels bad. And it&rsquo;s all the time like that.</p>

<p>Founders job here is to supporters to each other, motivate for further wins.</p>

<h2>What we learned so far</h2>

<p><strong> Product / Market Fit </strong> &ndash; basically all you do in startup is finding a balance between value you can propose and market that meets that value. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the initial idea is, more important is to be able to change direction and put maximum efforts to find the fit. The search could be blind or educated, educated search is probably more successful.</p>

<p>You will never know about that fit, before you try. Almost no idea will survive after it hits the customers. Steve Blanks calls that as &ldquo;getting out of the building&rdquo;, talk to people and show your product before you even built it and spend a lot of money for it.</p>

<p>The product have to solve real customer pain or need to survive.</p>

<p><strong> Metrics are important </strong> &ndash; all decisions have to be taken on metrics. Retention, Cohort analysis, Viral coefficients &ndash; that was all new words for me and only now I realize how metrics are important.</p>

<p>Startup dashboard that aggregates major metrics and KPI&rsquo;s is something that founders spend a lot of time with, finding new strategies and forecasting startup future. Measure everything.</p>

<p><strong> Marketing and Growth </strong> &ndash; current market is already very tight. People are constantly releasing new web and mobile applications, solving different problems, targeting different customer groups. You are a drop of water in the ocean and you have to be noticed to have growth.</p>

<p>I see marketing as car&rsquo;s engine starter &ndash; you built the car, put powerful engine, comfortable chairs and high quality audio system. But without starter, engine won&rsquo;t start and car won&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>At least basic marketing skills are vital for startup. If founders are more technically oriented (as we are) someone either have to learn it, or you have to hire specialist to help.</p>

<h2>Smooth pivot</h2>

<p>We are growing, average 10% per week. In the same time, we have quite low retention coefficient. People are quite excited about idea of application, but very fast they simply forget about and don&rsquo;t come back.</p>

<p>To be successful on B2C segment, you have to have hundred thousands of users to be sustainable. Likeastore is very far from sustain state as for now.</p>

<p>In the other hand, startup is great place to change your mind. I change my mind all the time. The change of mind in startup have a fancy word for it &ndash; pivot. Pivot is the change of direction that startup does, to find it&rsquo;s product / market fit.</p>

<p>We are going to pivot Likeastore in a very smooth way. As we previously was &ldquo;Dropbox of Likes&rdquo;, just allowing to collect and search.. we now want to try something like &ldquo;Pinterest of Likes&rdquo;, allowing people to collect best content into sharable collections, following that collections and collaborating on them.</p>

<h2>Ultimate goal</h2>

<p>We are putting our bar much higher. Our ultimate goal now is to gather 20.000 users at the end of the May 2014. If it happens, that would mean the idea of Likeastore is alive, otherwise the chances it survives are very low.</p>

<p>Both me and Dima really believe in what we do. We have the vision, will try to turn it to reality and either pivot or try something completely new.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-16T12:48:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/12/likeastore-is-becoming-a-company</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since my last update on <a href="https://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a> progress. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the application development is stopped, otherwise &ndash; we did a final breakthrough and today is my first day in <a href="http://eastlabs.co/">EastLabs</a> business accelerator. Yes, side project we&rsquo;ve started to have fun on hackathon is becoming a company today.</p>

<p>I always wanted to build a product that could became the foundation for company. I did a few unsuccessful attempts before. There was few reason of failures: either I tried to attack very big problem or I didn&rsquo;t have enough motivation to make the stuff done.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Likeastore appeared to be different &ndash; first, very positive feedback from out first public release. A lot of people being contacting us, sharing their impressions and asked for additional features. That gave an energy to proceed and improve existing features and design and plan for further grow. And second, I got brilliant co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> &ndash; besides great design and coding skills, he shares the passion of Likeastore product, so you don&rsquo;t feel alone in the dark.</p>

<p>Together, we did good team. I knew for sure, that technically we are unstoppable, but product development is not only coding. Realizing that we have a good beginning, very nice potential to grow &ndash; but absolutely not clear where to move on, depressed me a bit.</p>

<p>By the chance, I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/kiev-startup-party-tickets-8509553303">Startup Party</a> is taking place in Kiev. And I went there. That was a changing night. I&rsquo;ve met quite few interesting people there who are doing business in Ukraine. I was trying to understand which direction we should go, can someone help us. And of the most realistic ways was to apply to business accelerator. That night I got back home and spend a lot of time reading about business accelerators and options available in Kiev.</p>

<p>We applied to <a href="http://eastlabs.co/">EastLabs</a> accelerator program. We waited long, maybe about a month or so. I even thought, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen, so we need to find out other ways. But finally, we&rsquo;ve received invitation to interview (btw, I wish to say thanks to my friend Yulian who probably triggered that). The interview was really interesting, even if we are not accepted I would treat it as asset. It also took a bit of time from interview, but we finally received an offer from EastLabs to join their program.</p>

<p>Finally, then all cards there on on our hands we needed clearly decide, are we ready to start?</p>

<p>There was a lot doubts.. But there is also one strong feeling &ldquo;Now or never! It&rsquo;s already too late to step back&rdquo;.. We have a chance, now it&rsquo;s our primary job &ndash; not waste it.</p>

<p>So, now with <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> we are not only developers but also co-founders, ones that are responsible for company grow. That&rsquo;s just a begining of our ride. I only hope it&rsquo;s interesting and fun. For sure, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard, but I&rsquo;m ready to take a challenge.</p>

    <link href="http://beletsky.net/2013/12/analytics-for-your-startup.html"/>
    <updated>2013-12-05T15:32:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/12/analytics-for-your-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes ago I <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/07/think-ahead-think-logging.html">wrote the post</a>, where was thinking about importance of logging of application state to clearly see what&rsquo;s going on inside and react accordingly. Logging is vital for any reliable system.</p>

<p>If <em>logging</em> is a must from development point of view, <em>analytics</em> is a must from business point of view. You would like to see, how many users signs-in and signs-up during the day, what actions they do inside the app, what issues they use all the time, what issues they never touch.</p>

<p>Following &ldquo;Invent Own Bicycle&rdquo; principle, I&rsquo;ve created small project to attack the problem &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/seismo">Seismo</a>.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Right now, <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/seismo">seismo</a> repository is a bunch of javascript files and I&rsquo;m going to decouple project a bit to have it in more structured way. But in essence, there is REST API, with token-based authentication model, which allows you to push application events, store them to MongoDB and then build reports on those events.</p>

<p>To simplify the integration, there are <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/seismo-node-client">seismo-node-client</a>. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/request">request</a>-based application, ready to use from Node.js backends. Very soon, I&rsquo;m going to add <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/seismo-browser-client">seismo-browser-client</a> to be used in browser.</p>

<p>To allow the deployment be as easy as possible, I want to pack seismo server as <a href="http://www.docker.io/">docker</a> image and put it to public <a href="https://index.docker.io/">index</a>, so it could be deployed on any Linux machine with few seconds.</p>

<h2>Other languages support</h2>

<p>For now, it has good support for JavaScript and Express.js platform. I wish to have support for other platforms like, Ruby, Python, .NET and Java. It&rsquo;s important not only to support particular languages, but support particular platform &ndash; so, we have good examples and reusable components for RoR, ASP.NET MVC or Spring.</p>

<h2>Dashboard</h2>

<p>Data is useless without visualization. Seismo project includes <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/seismo-dashboard">seismo-dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pure client side application, build with Yeoman/Angular.js and could be deployed to any static server, it works great on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">gh-pages</a> as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://beletsky.net/images/blog/seismo-dashboard.png" alt="seismo dashboard" class="no-shadow" /></p>

<p>At the moment, the dashboard is not flexible at all. But I wish to create it fully customizable and widget based.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even if we already used that for <a href="https://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a> the project is far away from being generally used. The project currently is nothing more as prototype now, but I would like to improve it in nearest future, so I hope something interesting might came out.</p>
