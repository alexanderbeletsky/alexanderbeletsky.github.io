    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is exactly <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/03/likeastore-application-built-on.html">one year</a> as we started <a href="https://likeastore.com">Likeastore</a> project. It went through a different stages, from hack to side-project and finally transformed to real <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/12/likeastore-is-becoming-a-company.html">startup</a>.</p>

<p>The year, seems to be a huge period of time. It is, but I have to say it&rsquo;s only few last months (from the middle of December till today), we are fully dedicated to project. It&rsquo;s been great ride so far, so I wish to share some interesting moments.</p>

<!--More-->


<h2>What we started with</h2>

<p>Let me remind you, <a href="https://likeastore.com">Likeastore</a> is a web application that allow users to connect their social accounts and collect all their favorite items from them. We are 2 founders, me and <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">Dima</a> who committed themselves to build product that matters.</p>

<p>As founders we felt that &ldquo;likes&rdquo; are kind of new way of bookmarking. Then you favorite something on social network you do 2 things &ndash; you send appreciate to author content, as well as marking the content as interesting to you.</p>

<p>The problem that we try to solve. First, there are too many sources of information (social networks) where we spend time and receive content from, so tracking all social likes is extremely difficult. And second, it&rsquo;s very hard to find exact favorite item since social networks provide poor search functionality.</p>

<p>So, our initial hypothesis for application was &ndash; <em>people want to collect their likes in one place and be able to search them</em>.</p>

<h2>Where are we now</h2>

<p>After successful demonstration on hackathon, we&rsquo;ve reimplemented application from scratch and did first private beta in May 2013. It was pretty painful, since after 10 minutes of fly my inbox was full of error messages. But, general impression of people we spoken was positive. We&rsquo;ve crossed the line from hack to side project.</p>

<p>Our public beta released at July 2013. All major issues were solved, the infrastructure established and UI/UX of product were done. We were lucky enough to be featured by Codrops and after by SmashingMagazine twitter, which gave us first 500 beta users.</p>

<p>At the end of 2013 we&rsquo;ve dropped our full time jobs, joined business accelerator and totally focused on a product. I would say, that was the point then we crossed the next line, from side-project to startup.</p>

<p>We are at the full speed, full time, 2 people dedicated to Likeastore. And since then, we did major step forward. Let me share some of current statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>6.370 <strong>signups</strong> (+ ~4.000 from January till today)</li>
<li>2.700.000 <strong>likes collected</strong> (+ ~1.500.00 from January till today)</li>
<li>~200 <strong>active users</strong> (+185 from January till today)</li>
<li>~600 <strong>feedback emails received</strong></li>
<li>452 <strong>collections created</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>How does it feel like</h2>

<p>First of all, time flows 2x faster compare to anything I was involved before. You put yourself in a very constraint environment: lack of money, lack of time, not clear whats happens tomorrow. Multitasking is second name of startup, you don&rsquo;t have time to be focused on one task during the day.</p>

<p>Every day you feel ups and downs. The mood is changing constantly. You have growth and receive users feedback &ndash; it feels great. You talk to investors or mentors that find weaks and leaks of idea &ndash; it feels bad. And it&rsquo;s all the time like that.</p>

<p>Founders job here is to supporters to each other, motivate for further wins.</p>

<h2>What we learned so far</h2>

<p><strong> Product / Market Fit </strong> &ndash; basically all you do in startup is finding a balance between value you can propose and market that meets that value. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the initial idea is, more important is to be able to change direction and put maximum efforts to find the fit. The search could be blind or educated, educated search is probably more successful.</p>

<p>You will never know about that fit, before you try. Almost no idea will survive after it hits the customers. Steve Blanks calls that as &ldquo;getting out of the building&rdquo;, talk to people and show your product before you even built it and spend a lot of money for it.</p>

<p>The product have to solve real customer pain or need to survive.</p>

<p><strong> Metrics are important </strong> &ndash; all decisions have to be taken on metrics. Retention, Cohort analysis, Viral coefficients &ndash; that was all new words for me and only now I realize how metrics are important.</p>

<p>Startup dashboard that aggregates major metrics and KPI&rsquo;s is something that founders spend a lot of time with, finding new strategies and forecasting startup future. Measure everything.</p>

<p><strong> Marketing and Growth </strong> &ndash; current market is already very tight. People are constantly releasing new web and mobile applications, solving different problems, targeting different customer groups. You are a drop of water in the ocean and you have to be noticed to have growth.</p>

<p>I see marketing as car&rsquo;s engine starter &ndash; you built the car, put powerful engine, comfortable chairs and high quality audio system. But without starter, engine won&rsquo;t start and car won&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>At least basic marketing skills are vital for startup. If founders are more technically oriented (as we are) someone either have to learn it, or you have to hire specialist to help.</p>

<h2>Smooth pivot</h2>

<p>We are growing, average 10% per week. In the same time, we have quite low retention coefficient. People are quite excited about idea of application, but very fast they simply forget about and don&rsquo;t come back.</p>

<p>To be successful on B2C segment, you have to have hundred thousands of users to be sustainable. Likeastore is very far from sustain state as for now.</p>

<p>In the other hand, startup is great place to change your mind. I change my mind all the time. The change of mind in startup have a fancy word for it &ndash; pivot. Pivot is the change of direction that startup does, to find it&rsquo;s product / market fit.</p>

<p>We are going to pivot Likeastore in a very smooth way. As we previously was &ldquo;Dropbox of Likes&rdquo;, just allowing to collect and search.. we now want to try something like &ldquo;Pinterest of Likes&rdquo;, allowing people to collect best content into sharable collections, following that collections and collaborating on them.</p>

<h2>Ultimate goal</h2>

<p>We are putting our bar much higher. Our ultimate goal now is to gather 20.000 users at the end of the May 2014. If it happens, that would mean the idea of Likeastore is alive, otherwise the chances it survives are very low.</p>

<p>Both me and Dima really believe in what we do. We have the vision, will try to turn it to reality and either pivot or try something completely new.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-16T12:48:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/12/likeastore-is-becoming-a-company</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since my last update on <a href="https://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a> progress. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the application development is stopped, otherwise &ndash; we did a final breakthrough and today is my first day in <a href="http://eastlabs.co/">EastLabs</a> business accelerator. Yes, side project we&rsquo;ve started to have fun on hackathon is becoming a company today.</p>

<p>I always wanted to build a product that could became the foundation for company. I did a few unsuccessful attempts before. There was few reason of failures: either I tried to attack very big problem or I didn&rsquo;t have enough motivation to make the stuff done.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p>Likeastore appeared to be different &ndash; first, very positive feedback from out first public release. A lot of people being contacting us, sharing their impressions and asked for additional features. That gave an energy to proceed and improve existing features and design and plan for further grow. And second, I got brilliant co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> &ndash; besides great design and coding skills, he shares the passion of Likeastore product, so you don&rsquo;t feel alone in the dark.</p>

<p>Together, we did good team. I knew for sure, that technically we are unstoppable, but product development is not only coding. Realizing that we have a good beginning, very nice potential to grow &ndash; but absolutely not clear where to move on, depressed me a bit.</p>

<p>By the chance, I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/kiev-startup-party-tickets-8509553303">Startup Party</a> is taking place in Kiev. And I went there. That was a changing night. I&rsquo;ve met quite few interesting people there who are doing business in Ukraine. I was trying to understand which direction we should go, can someone help us. And of the most realistic ways was to apply to business accelerator. That night I got back home and spend a lot of time reading about business accelerators and options available in Kiev.</p>

<p>We applied to <a href="http://eastlabs.co/">EastLabs</a> accelerator program. We waited long, maybe about a month or so. I even thought, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen, so we need to find out other ways. But finally, we&rsquo;ve received invitation to interview (btw, I wish to say thanks to my friend Yulian who probably triggered that). The interview was really interesting, even if we are not accepted I would treat it as asset. It also took a bit of time from interview, but we finally received an offer from EastLabs to join their program.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XS72t-TDB9w/Uq7xtL3JD2I/AAAAAAAAad8/bzEJdq2GZN4/w1736-h1302-no/IMG_20131216_135239.jpg" alt="likeastore"/></p>

<p>Finally, then all cards there on on our hands we needed clearly decide, are we ready to start?</p>

<p>There was a lot doubts.. But there is also one strong feeling &ldquo;Now or never! It&rsquo;s already too late to step back&rdquo;.. We have a chance, now it&rsquo;s our primary job &ndash; not waste it.</p>

<p>So, now with <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> we are not only developers but also co-founders, ones that are responsible for company grow. That&rsquo;s just a begining of our ride. I only hope it&rsquo;s interesting and fun. For sure, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard, but I&rsquo;m ready to take a challenge.</p>

    <link href="http://beletsky.net/2013/08/first-week-in-the-air.html"/>
    <updated>2013-08-06T05:40:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/08/first-week-in-the-air</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a week how <a href="https://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a> application went public. I was amazed with initial reaction and feedback. Right now, we have 730 sign-ups, 844 social networks connected and 117950 likes collected. That mean, we had ~100 signups per day and it&rsquo;s growing.</p>

<p>Here is a little retrospective on the things happened through that seven days.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Few hours after release</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve deployed about 6.00 PM at Saturday, sending out a bunch of invitation latters. Right after that, users began to register.</p>

<p>Small script that sends <em>&ldquo;New user registered&rdquo;</em> notification has been rolled out as well, so it was easy to see how things are going. Saturday both me and <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> were completely tired. No doubt, it has been quite an exhausting journey, we worked hard last 3 weeks at nights and weekends, so I just came home and fall asleep, just checking that application is still running.</p>

<h2>Unpredictable thing</h2>

<p>Next morning, I found a bunch of emails in my box, maybe 40-50 subscribed. Mostly from my &ldquo;nearest&rdquo; network, after notification in twitter and facebook.</p>

<p>But then, something unpredictable happened &ndash; we&rsquo;ve announced in amazing <a href="http://t.co/4DinPVlcdk">Collective #74</a> issue.</p>

<p>That gave us a lot of traffic and sign-ups. Monday and Tuesday, we had a rush hours then every minute new user sign-up. My phone was ringing all the time, and my email box was full of notifications. People were <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=likeastore&amp;src=typd">tweeting</a> about, we recieved few request for new service connectors as well.</p>

<p>I have to say, I was really pleased with that. We did something noticeable, something that other people liked.</p>

<h2>First problems</h2>

<p>Real user experience shows real application issues. We had few..</p>

<p>First is that our app failed to work in IE. It appeared that our <em>nginx</em> configuration. Since we are using <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> for deployment, it have to be fixed there. Thanks to Dokku community, the issue has been resolved rather quickly and fix being <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku/commit/33a3b85674e92fe883ba3151dee861f53914718a">pushed</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing, that was not possible to see without some <em>real</em> data &ndash; stackoverflow OAuth token is very short living.. So, if you enabled stackoverlow connector, next day it fail to collect the data, since token in not valid any more. Unfortunately, there is no way to workaround this issue automatically, only ask user to re-enable the network.</p>

<p>We had several outages of data collection caused be bugs not noticed on staging. Also, to improve <em>initial collecting velocity</em>, we run 2 instances of collector in parallel. That worked, so just subscribed users are served fast, but it&rsquo;s not ideal yet.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s coming?</h2>

<p>The last week was really motivating. We are continue to improve the service and expecting new users to come.</p>

<p>Through the next month we&rsquo;ll be focusing on:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook connector</strong> &ndash; the top most requested connector to be implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Likes indexing</strong> &ndash; currenly implemented search is very simple, just to show the idea, what is really needed is to perform the search based in likes content.</li>
<li><strong>UI improvements</strong> &ndash; we are still improving the design of application, to make it attractive and unique.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> &ndash; our core component <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/collector">collector</a> will be deployed on dedicated core 2 machine and re-written to be easily scaled.</li>
<li><strong>CDN</strong> &ndash; currently all static resources are handled by node.js, which is terrible slow, will move all our stuff to Amazon CloudFront.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://beletsky.net/2013/07/likeastore-app-goes-to-public.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-28T09:30:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/07/likeastore-app-goes-to-public</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 4 month the project <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/03/likeastore-application-built-on.html">started</a> on hackathon and called <a href="https://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a>. Yesterday, it&rsquo;s been pushed out to public and I feel really great about that. Started out as quick hack, it eventually became a real product.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping is always hard, despite of the actual product size. Finishing something that other people will see, just doubles the stake &ndash; you could not fail, wish to do best of the best. It&rsquo;s been really breathtaking journey (or I would call it beginning of the path), so if you are interested I&rsquo;ll share some details of product and it&rsquo;s development.</p>

<!--More-->


<p><img src="/images/blog/likeastore-home.png" alt="likeastore" /></p>

<h2>Likeastore in few simple words</h2>

<p>We all connected to a different social systems, like twitter, github or stackoverlow. All of those are constant flow of information and we clasiffy that information by &ldquo;liking&rdquo; them.</p>

<p>The usual problem though, is it&rsquo;s very hard to remember where you saw some information. For instance, I just remember <em>&ldquo;hm..I read great post of configuring nginx for Node.js application..&rdquo;</em>, but totally forget &ndash; was on github readme, twitted blog post or answer on stackoverflow.</p>

<blockquote><p>Likeastore tool that helps you to survive information overload.</p></blockquote>

<p>Likeastore fixes the problem, it stores all information that you might be interested in, by collecting your &ldquo;likes&rdquo; throught a different social applications and allow you to search that information.</p>

<h2>After hackathon time</h2>

<p>We took a second place on hackathon and a lot of people were interested in Likeastore idea. We just wanted to make it right and enhance the code we already had.</p>

<p>Our plan was simple: make everything we had right, improve the UI and found reliable hosting for our product. As this is done, we go for a private mode, sharing application with limited number of users. If everything is good, will release it public. Pretty standard approach for different kinds of SaaS.</p>

<p>At May, 2013 we had our application deployed on <a href="https://www.appfog.com/">AppFog</a> and subscribers been invited.</p>

<h2>Private beta results</h2>

<p>After few hours on production site running, we&rsquo;ve got first users, first real data and even first feedback in twitter.
But what&rsquo;s more important, we&rsquo;ve got a logs full of errors and understanding we are not that far from previous milestone.</p>

<p>Application stopped to work on next day. We&rsquo;ve <a href="http://beletsky.net/2013/07/why-we-moved-from-appfog-to-nodejitsu.html">moved</a> to another PaaS <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodejitsu</a>. A lot of different things happen.</p>

<p>Looking back, I have to say &ndash; <em>it&rsquo;s great we didn&rsquo;t show it to public immediately</em>, cause it would be a bit shameful. Decrypting the logs, gave us better understanding of problems you face collecting big amount of data through different API&rsquo;s. There was obviously huge amount of work to make it better.</p>

<h2>Focusing on quality</h2>

<p>Originally, we&rsquo;ve planned to push more features to public version: facebook and tumlr connectors, full text search and other stuff. But private beta clearly showed &ndash; the <em>focus have to be on quality</em>.</p>

<p>We literally re-wrote the application from scratch, both server side and client. Applied integration tests and unit tests whereever it&rsquo;s possible, also covering main application pathes with zombie.js <a href="http://pixelhunter.me/post/54753803233/end-to-end-testing-with-zombie-js-mocha-js-and">end-to-end</a> tests.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/app/tree/master/source/api">API</a> became stable and fully tested, our <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/app/tree/master/public/js">client</a> solid rock and very reliable. The trickiest part of application, the <a href="https://github.com/likeastore/collector">collector</a> &ndash; it became smarter, with a scheduler that schedules optimal requests to avoid API rate limits.</p>

<h2>Making the product beautiful</h2>

<p>Beautiful UI/UX for applications like a crucial. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy that <a href="https://twitter.com/voronianski">@voronianski</a> is a part of team.</p>

<p>He did amazing job by visualizing both site and application. Design became very clean, contrast and looks great on numerous of devices, from smart phones to huge desktop monitors.</p>

<p>Following the modern trend of flat design, we&rsquo;ve picked up colors and styles, showing the way we see application, as modern and useful. Just <em>making the things look nicer</em> would be a real further strategy for us.</p>

<h2>Security is concern</h2>

<p>We collect users private data, it was obvioulsy just impossible to give a chance of someone else access it. So, have to secure the application with SSL connection, so all trafic between API and browser is crypted. SSL became a quite hard, first because certificate is rather expensive, second you have to install on server, which I never did before.</p>

<p>The importance of SSL left us with a no-go on <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodejitsu</a>. Nodejitsu policies allows to have SSL connections only on &ldquo;Bussiness Plan&rdquo;, which costs 120USD/month. That was not that money we ready to put on table. We had to have change the way we host application. Basically, it meant &ndash; move out from PaaS to IaaS, and do all the stuff on your own.</p>

<p>I personally felt bad about, since we&rsquo;ve really get used to PaaS. But, we&rsquo;ve found a way around, having place own application on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> cloud, in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">dokku</a>, which allows us to Heroku-like deployment model. That also gave me the chance to play vagrant/linux/docker more that I could ever image. I contributed <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">dokku</a> some important stuff as SSL and ENV support and that gave ability to use it for production needs.</p>

<h2>Current technology stack</h2>

<p>So, a little bit of geeky info. We running on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, 2 droplets one for staging and one for production</li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> 1.4, ssl, routing and balancing 2 Node.js servers on each droplet</li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> 0.8.25 + <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> based API</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mongohq.com/home">MongoHQ</a> deplyment for staging and production database</li>
<li>Each Node.js server runs in <a href="http://www.docker.io/">docker</a> container</li>
<li>Deployments and docker orchestration by <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">dokku</a></li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> driven client</li>
<li>Handcrafted CSS, HTML (no frameworks)</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these is very interesting and demands dedicated posts. Hope, we do some in future.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Just current results: 18 hours after, we have 40 users, 62 network connections, 10861 item collected. That&rsquo;s the motivating stuff, so we feel very positive to carry that on.</p>

    <link href="http://beletsky.net/2013/07/why-we-moved-from-appfog-to-nodejitsu.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-19T19:36:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2013/07/why-we-moved-from-appfog-to-nodejitsu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://likeastore.com/">Likeastore</a> started to use <a href="https://www.appfog.com/">AppFog</a> as PaaS during private beta campaign. That was great idea initially since AppFog offers really nice conditions: 8 running instances with 256MB or RAM, custom domain names, support and all relative services. I have to say, it did work fine at the beginning, allowing us to push product forward and show it to our subscribers.</p>

<p>But very fast we realized that AppFog does not suite us at lot.</p>

<!--More-->


<h2>Why to mess up with PaaS?</h2>

<p>If you never tried things like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://www.appfog.com/">AppFog</a>, or <a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHabor</a> you might have a question, why to pay for something you &ldquo;almost&rdquo; can do your self just by renting VPS.</p>

<p>Renting VPS seems to be nice idea, but the problem is &ndash; you taking to much responsibility to manage the server by your own. You have to have certain skills to configure nginx, git repositories, ssh keys etc. It&rsquo;s possible to do, but it takes a lot time.. time you can spend on code something will be spend to configure something.</p>

<p>Another very important point is deployments. Usually deployments are hard and time consuming, since you have to do them manually. But with PaaS all you have to do to deploy the up is either, <code>git push</code> to some remote repo.. or call a special script like <code>af push app</code>, to do all the magic.</p>

<p>For small companies and side-projects PaaS is a really good opportunity to actually ship something, instead of fail to customize the web server.</p>

<h2>Why AppFog?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about AppFog before from twitter and hacker news. It looked very attractive.</p>

<p>But it was not the only one on the market. So, really competitive feature for me was: 8 running instances, for 20 USD. Very good price. We need 4 at that time, so AppFog was very good choice.</p>

<p>But as always, with time you start to see some negative moments. Something that lead us to finally drop AppFog. I would like to quickly go through good and less good things.</p>

<h2>Dashboard and UI</h2>

<p>AppFog dashboard is quite nicely designed. But sometimes I felt difficulties to just find the things.</p>

<p>I was not happy with performance of dashboard as well. It was really slow for me usually, so you click to check instance state and wait for 30 seconds while the page opens. You can leave with that, but the time comes than you start to hate it.</p>

<h2>AppFog CLI</h2>

<p>To create / run / stop applications on AppFog, you get a special command line utility, called <code>af</code>. It&rsquo;s typically for all PaaS to have some CLI to communicate to it. It&rsquo;s easy to install and configure, everything is nice.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s written on Ruby, so you won&rsquo;t have any problems on Mac, but Ruby have to installed on Windows machine.</p>

<p>Once it&rsquo;s installed you have to login to you AppFog account and start to deploy.</p>

<h2>Deployment experience</h2>

<p>Even if CLI itself was quite nicely done, deployment experience was not so nice &ndash; it was too slow.</p>

<p>Node.js is deployment-friendly platform. No build steps, no linking, no packaging &ndash; nothing. All you have to do, is to push the sources to remote machine. Sure, PaaS is doing a lot magic behind the scences, like firing new virtual machines and configuring network interfaces etc.</p>

<p>And all that magic for AppFog works too long.</p>

<p>Deployment could took up to 40 seconds, which is fine if you do it once in week. But it bothers you a lot while you do that once in hour.</p>

<h2>Release management</h2>

<p>If your plan is continuous delivery and frequent deployments, you have to be ready for frequent rollbacks as well. Without that feature, you are in trouble.</p>

<p>AppFog does not afford anything like that. Correctly say, you have to do it manually, like tagging sources, then fetching by tag and push again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not big issue, I would say. Nevertheless, developers are too optimistic thinking that everything works great (and indeed in always works fine, on my machine), but the time you see issues on production you just panic and loosing control of what to do.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>Even if you running tiny bussiness and no one hurt if your application is down, still you expect that you&rsquo;ll get help if you are in trouble. That&rsquo;s the whole idea of support, especially if you pay money for it.</p>

<p>AppFog support is not good. Few times my tickets were unanswered for 2 days. Then they answered I found the reason or was able to fix it by myself.</p>

<p>This is just makes very bad impression of service. You start to think, it&rsquo;s not so reliable, so the time you&rsquo;ll be really screwed, they won&rsquo;t come help.</p>

<h2>Load balancing and cookies</h2>

<p>So, all mentioned above is something that we would prioritize as &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; issues. A bit ugly, but you can leave with it. The real and unexpected problem appeared as we did first announcement and users came to check the application.</p>

<p>We are using <a href="">passport</a> for user authorization, which depends on sessions. Each request contains contains a <code>session_state</code> which being persisted in cookie. The problem was that, on AppFog for some unknown dropped that <code>session_state</code>. So, after user just logged on and clicked somewhere, she was immediately redirected back to login page, as unauthorized.</p>

<p>Absolutely unclear behavior to me.</p>

<p>I definitely know I&rsquo;m not the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=appfog+session+lost&amp;oq=appfog+session+lost">only one</a> who was suffering that issue. Supported failed to answer quickly and even on my next request they didn&rsquo;t provide anything constructive.</p>

<p>That was the show-stopper with AppFog.</p>

<h2>.. and now Nodejitsu?</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, I just deployed application to <a href="">Nodejtsu</a> and it worked fine there. I was really happy to see the features I missed with AppFog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear and fast dashboard</li>
<li>Release management (you can go back and forth with any version you deployed)</li>
<li>Node.js written CLI and fast deployments</li>
<li>Good support</li>
</ul>


<p>The time we joined Nodejitsu it costs 33 USD for 3 instances, that didn&rsquo;t match our needs ideally, but we had to embrace the constraints.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I know, there is nothing ideal in this world &ndash; but if you have choice, it&rsquo;s fine pick up best (or at least better). I would not say AppFog completely sucks, but it didn&rsquo;t work for me as I was expecting.</p>

<p>PS. While writing this post I&rsquo;ve noticed that AppFog being <a href="https://www.appfog.com/savvis/">acquired</a> by CentruLink. I only wish that it would positively affect service and support, so wish good luck for AppFog.</p>
