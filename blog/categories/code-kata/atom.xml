    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
    <p>        Last weekend the good friends of mine were organizing great event, <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">CodeRetreat</a> in Odessa. I supposed to be there, but due to bad luck I missed that. Nevertheless, I was very interested in CodeRetreat idea, so I followed up the materials and learned a bit about it. <br />
    </p>    <p>        CodeRetreat is about the software craftsmanship. You focus on <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">4 principles of Simple Design</a>, work in pairs through the series of time boxed sessions, each time starting from scratch (yes, all code produced on previous sessions is destroyed with no mercy). All of that aim one simple goal, became a better developer. For the implementation they selected famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. The cellular automata, with simple rules but given very interesting results and foundation for numerous researches.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To do not stay with my misery of missing event, I decided to "play" game of life at home. Trying to follow the rules of sessions, I started to write some JavaScript code. It's even hard to tell, how much fun I had during this implementation.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Tests, code, tests</h2>    <p>        TDD is very recommended way of development in CodeRetreats. I love TDD and fortunately the game of life is very TDD friendly. It's all about the logic. Logic seems to be very simple and easy describe with tests. For my JavaScript testing I used to use <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> testing framework. Jasmine is BDD tests style, which was a little difficult to me at very beginning, but not I tend to write all my tests with BDD style.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I've spent first two sessions for idea elaboration. At the end third session, I got something working. As I said, the process of writing that code was so fun to me, that I even decided to <a href="https://gist.github.com/3763692">gist</a> the code I created so far. <br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bBm_BGTuy1I/UGQSj4MCYCI/AAAAAAAAJfk/m1aRicC5pYY/s622/image-2.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bBm_BGTuy1I/UGQSj4MCYCI/AAAAAAAAJfk/m1aRicC5pYY/s622/image-2.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        My big disappointment after was that code is actually not working.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>    <p>        Even if I had good tests suite, that showed my code works as expected the game was broken. And the issue is that I didn't understand the domain good enough. It took me 4 sessions (about 4 hours) to finally understand the game.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I proved it once again for myself, there are no perfect code; the code you created at first time is probably broken (unless you understand the domain perfectly, but it's rarely happen in reality). It's OK to completely remove the code you created before and start from the beginning. And with each iteration you moving faster and faster.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HYIZR9Ssup4/UGQSj97MsoI/AAAAAAAAJfg/WZSrfAQcyd8/s622/image-3.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HYIZR9Ssup4/UGQSj97MsoI/AAAAAAAAJfg/WZSrfAQcyd8/s622/image-3.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        Knowing the requirements I was able to create good test suite. <br />
    </p>    <h2>Algorithms and data structures</h2>    <p>        During the implementation, you have to recall some basics algorithms and data structures. My initial implementation was based on usage of 2-dimensional arrays. It seems to be very natural fit, since the game is happening on orthogonal grid of square cells. But during the implementation of cell replication logic I suffered that design.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Index arithmetic is very tricky and error-prone stuff. So, after several tries I switched from array into the list of cells, each cell holds it's state and position. The <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/gameoflife/blob/master/public/js/grid.js#L24">tick</a> method of became very elegant, containing 2-pass procedure - one to calculate next state of each state, second is to switch to new state.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JvlS1nI_Ay8/UGQSkXu3r-I/AAAAAAAAJfo/slOlEKrDXvo/s622/image-4.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JvlS1nI_Ay8/UGQSkXu3r-I/AAAAAAAAJfo/slOlEKrDXvo/s622/image-4.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        Again, I was so happy with code. It looked very readable as for me, without nested cycles and if-else statements.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Visualisation</h2>    <p>        You can really understand if something works or not, only if you see it in action. I had to have some UI to see, how game is actually working. <br />
    </p>    <p>        I've created very simple HTML based UI. The number of div's which change it's state, depending on cell state (alive or dead).<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ERo-PofMktc/UGQSjwS4NBI/AAAAAAAAJfc/bOOBADibPGk/s622/image-1.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ERo-PofMktc/UGQSjwS4NBI/AAAAAAAAJfc/bOOBADibPGk/s622/image-1.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        The visualization of results is very important part. It's only then I tried to run the game on 64x64 square, I realized that performance of my implementation is so terribly poor. It runs very slowly on Chrome, it makes IE10 die.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It means that, all beautiful code, tests, specs and so on - is almost useless, than it comes to performance. My 2-pass algorithm, with a simple implementation is not "production" ready, if we talk about some real software. Unit tests are usually done on smaller sets of data. Visualisation and trying the things on larger set of data opens up the reality.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        As I already said, it's so much fun. It makes you feel like "back to roots", forget about your enterprise stuff and do some real work. Besides it's great TDD exercise. It's probably to big to be called code kata, but it is still great for sharping an axe. Focusing on simple design is important. But making things "visible" and running them in real mode is vital. <br />
    </p>    <p>        The most important conclusion for me is: I'm still newbie developer, with so many areas to improve.<br />

    <updated>2012-05-26T15:03:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2012/05/limit-of-keystrokes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Some time ago I've posted an article called <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/07/how-to-be-better-developer-or-3.html">How to be better developer or 3 accounts rule</a> where I shared my vision on importance of having some accounts if you care about professionalism and mastery. The basic idea there is you have to produce a lot, you have to write a lot. You have to write code, write blog posts and help people on forums.<br />
</p><p>If you have seen one of the latest Scott Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ItsNotWhatYouReadItsWhatYouIgnoreVideoOfScottHanselmansPersonalProductivityTips.aspx">Productivity Tips</a> video, you probably heard nice metaphor about the "Limit of Keystrokes". It sounds really funny, Scott saying - "everybody is having limited count of keystokes, if you reach you count - you dead". That means, we have to think on each keystroke we do with much care. <br />
</p><p>And the most efficient usage of keystrokes is for learning. Reading is very important, but nowadays there are so many information that you just not able to consume everything. That's why recently I've unsubscribed a lot of RSS channels in my Google Reader, I think I will filter the Twitter as well. Instead, I try to read as few things as possible. Not only read, but try them on practice. Just write some small code to try the idea, pattern, approach of framework. Turning the theory in practice is something that gives me much fun and satisfaction.<br />
</p><p>Yesterday, we were doing Coding Dojo with good friend of mine <a href="http://twitter.com/skalinets">@skalinets</a> on <a href="http://agilebasecamp.org/">Agile Base Camp</a> conference. Instead of going my default language (which is C# for now) I paired the PHP guy. We were doing String Calculator kata in PHP. It was so great! First of all, I amazed how much PHP improved since the last time I looked on it (about 10 years ago), second is that I used my keystrokes to learn something new. <br />
</p><p>Writing the code for fun and learning has a huge value. This is definitely good investment of the keystrokes.  <br />

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Extension methods and clean code]]></title>
    <link href="http://beletsky.net/2011/02/extension-methods-and-clean-code.html"/>
    <updated>2011-02-10T10:52:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://beletsky.net/2011/02/extension-methods-and-clean-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx">Extension methods</a> is one of my favorite features of C# language. It appeared from version 3.0 and became very popular.
</p>
<p>
The main goal of Extension Methods is to provide ability of extension of any class, without creating any derived classes, modifying original type or do "whatever" hacks. It is allowed to extend any type with any functionality in a very seamless fashion. What also great about Extension Methods is they allow to beautifully emulate behavior usually called pipelining (in <a href="http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/pipelining-in-f/">F#</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">Bash</a>) and implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern">Chain of responsibility</a> pattern.
</p>
<p>
But the most important as for me - Extension Methods help to keep my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">code clean</a>. Clean code criteria is something I concerned a lot, nowadays.
</p>
<p>
I recently started to practice with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">code katas</a>, that I found essential for any developers who cares about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SharpenTheSawForDevelopers.aspx">keeping their saw sharp</a>. So, after several iterations I came up with extension methods implementation that I pretty happy about. I'm using Roy Osherove's <a href="http://www.osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">StringCalculator</a> kata. It is about the implementation of simple method <code>Add</code> that:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes numbers separated by delimiter, as string</li>
<li>Determines if custom delimiter is set</li>
<li>Split up original string to array of number tokens</li>
<li>Validates the input (no negatives allowed) and returns the sum of numbers, ignoring numbers greater than 1000</li>
</ul>
<p>
I would like to show to you both implementation and try to evaluate them from "clean code" point of view.
</p>
<p>
Original one (this is of cause a little "unwinded" version, I had a different structure with smaller methods.. But idea still the same).
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;">
public int Add(string numbers)
{
    var delimiters = new[] { ",", "\n" };

    if (IsCustomDelimeterProvided(numbers))
    {
        delimiters = GetDelimitersFromNumbers(numbers);
    }

    var processed = numbers;
    if (IsCustomDelimeterProvided(numbers))
    {
        processed = processed.Substring(processed.IndexOf('\n') + 1);
    }

    if (IsContainDelimeters(processed, delimiters))
    {
        var splittedNumbers = numbers.Split(delimiters, StringSplitOptions.None);
        var validation = new NumbersValidation();

        foreach (var number in splittedNumbers)
        {
            validation.Check(number);
        }

        validation.Validate();

        return splittedNumbers.Sum(p => GetIntegerWithCondition(p, IgnoreNumbersMoreThatThousand()));
    }

    return Convert.ToInt32(processed);
}
</pre>
<p>
Do you think is this code clean? I don't think so.. Of cause, it might be not so difficult to understand it, but:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Method is just too long</li>
<li>A lot of <code>if</code> statements make it difficult to see instruction flow</li>
<li>It messes up "infrastructure" code (splits, validation) with primary functionality (sum of numbers)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's try to read it: <i>I got the numbers and I check if custom delimiter is set on the beginning of numbers string, if so I try to extract the custom delimiters from original string. After I pre-process the string to remove custom delimiter prefix, so do not break the rest of function. If numbers string contains the delimiters, I split it up, perform the validation by helper object (which will throw exception is something wrong). Run Sum algorithm that would: covert string to integer and ignore one if it is greater that 1000.. Otherwise, it just tries to convert to integer and return</i>.
</p>
<p>
A lot of words, a lot of ifs isn't it? Thats not good.
</p>
<p>
Now, my last implementation with using of Extension Methods:
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp;">
public int Add(string numbers)
{
    var defaultDelimiters = new string[] { ",", "\n" };
    var delimiters = numbers.CustomDelimiters().Concat(defaultDelimiters).ToArray();

    return numbers.Replace(" ", "").Split(delimiters, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
        .RemoveSpecialSymbols().ToIntegersArray().ValidateIntegersArray().IgnoreIntegersGreatThanThousand().Sum();
}
</pre>
<p>
Do you feel the power? I definitely do!
</p>
<p>
I believe that this code is very clean. It basically does not require any comments, because it looks like "plain English" explanation of what's the functionality is all about! Anyway, let's try to read: <i>I extract custom delimiters from numbers string and concatenate them with default delimiters. I replace all space with empty symbol (note: this step is not in original requirement, but I put it to keep code robust), then I split them with delimiters ignoring empty lines. After I remove all special symbols in numbers string and convert the result to array of integers. I validate this array (no negatives) and ignore any numbers great than thousand. At the end I sum up everything and return the result</i>.
</p>
<p>
What is good about this code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Method is very short
</li>
<li>
All details are hidden
</li>
<li>
Control flow is very straightforward
</li>
<li>
All dependent methods has meaningful names
</li>
<li>
Method does exactly what it is suppose to do
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Well, don't get me wrong here. I'm not saying that now only Extension Methods is a way of solving the issues. Of cause not. But if you feel the smell of pipeline of chain of responsibility patters, extension methods are right choice. As always you should consider to do not "overplay" with some particular feature of language/framework. 
</p>
