I do use Blogger as my blog engine and really like it. Right, as soon as you create your blog posts in 
    HTML and do not use embedded editor it is perfectly fine! So, when I do new post I create a plain 
    HTML in VS and after it is ready I copy paste it to blogspot and publish. Original 
    HTML I commit special repository on github.  
</p>
<p>
I liked that style of work as far I as I change nothing in posts. As I need change, I have to change original 
    HTML, re-publish it on blogspot and commit again to github. After I did it 
    several times, I started to think how to automate this? I came up this a simple 
    idea, why do not load the content of post dynamically, by using a javascript? 
</p>
<p>
It is no problem to do that, and I implemented a small script that performs exactly what I needed. I called this project <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/GithubToBlogspot">GithubToBlogspot</a>. Its description:
</p>
<p>
GithubToBlogspot is used for people who stores they blog article sources in HTML.
Instead copy pasting HTML between blogspot and github, it should be possible to paste a simple script on a page and that 
script would load a content.
</p>
<p>
It utilized javascript GitHub API by: http://github.com/fitzgen/github-api
</p>
<p>
First draft example looks like this,
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">&#60;</font><font color="#800000">div</font> <font color="#ff0000">id</font><font color="#0000ff">="content1"</font> <font color="#ff0000">class</font><font color="#0000ff">="load"</font> <font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br>Loading your content, please wait...<br><font color="#0000ff">&#60;</font><font color="#800000">img</font> <font color="#ff0000">src</font><font color="#0000ff">="http://www.sanbaldo.com/wordpress/wp-content/mozilla_giallo.gif"</font> <font color="#0000ff">/&#62;</font><br><font color="#0000ff">&#60;/</font><font color="#800000">div</font><font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br><font color="#0000ff">&#60;</font><font color="#800000">script</font> <font color="#ff0000">type</font><font color="#0000ff">="text/javascript"</font><font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> __user = <font color="#A31515">"alexanderbeletsky"</font>; <font color="#0000ff">var</font> __repo = <font color="#A31515">"Blog"</font>; <font color="#0000ff">var</font> __sha = <font color="#A31515">"16fe3ddf21925508490d91978cf581a13bc37b6c"</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> __path = <font color="#A31515">"07112010/GitHubSocialCoding.htm"</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> __div = <font color="#A31515">"content1"</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;githubToBlogspot(__user, __repo, __path, __sha, __div);<br><font color="#0000ff">&#60;/</font><font color="#800000">script</font><font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br></font><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
Code itself is also really simple: it opens the blob, reads its data as HTML, extracts the body and put body to target div. That&#8217;s it. All this done asynchronously, so as you open the blog you see progress image.. after data loaded it appears on screen.
</p>
<p>
But I haven&#8217;t taken into account several major considerations:
<ul>
<li>First, AJAX content is not crawlable by Google. It <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html">actually is</a>, but requires a changes that could not be done, since you are on 3rd party blog engine.</li>
<li>
Second, is with that dynamic loading RSS feed of blog will also be empty.
</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
I still want to accomplish this. I was thinking about different solutions, but have no solid one.. Do you know is it possible to accomplish something similar with no drawbacks I mentioned above. It would be great if you share you ideas!

First of all, what the JSON is? It is very, very simple! JSON  acronym of a JavaScript Object Notation. It is a data interchange format, analog of XML. It became very popular because of AJAX applications, which receive a data from web services called from a javascript. Web services typically use XML as format of exchanging data, that works great because of SOAP standard and so on.. But in javascript client application you had to put additional effort of parsing XML data, and create an XML to post to web service. JSON simplifies it, because it is native to javascript.
</p>
<p>
JSON is a serialization of javascript object to string. It based on javascript basic types as Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object and null and looks like that: 
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#A31515">"id"</font>: 1023,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#A31515">"description"</font>: <font color="#A31515">"new assigment"</font>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#A31515">"data"</font>: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#A31515">"size"</font>: 117,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#A31515">"url"</font>: <font color="#A31515">"/local/data/jhsr2kk"</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br> }</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
As you receive such string from web service (for instance) you can just evaluate it (with eval() function) and use as javascipt object. (I have to mention that direct using of eval() is not recommended way since security issues, all modern browsers have built-in JSON parsers and you can use that. Best way is to use a libraries, like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and hides such details from you).
</p>
<p>
JSON exchanging of data works great as soon as your application and data source service are in one domain. As you want to receive some data outside of your domain, it simply won&#8217;t work (it actually works, with IE but it gives security notification and does not work in Chrome at all). This because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same origin policy</a>, security concept that disallow such operations. So, as you considered to do something like, 
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">$.getJSON(<font color="#A31515">"http://external.com/json"</font>, <font color="#0000ff">function</font>(data) { });</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
you will not get any result. There are a different approaches of workaround of same policy origin (please check nice <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2010/01/10/loading-external-content-with-ajax-using-jquery-and-yql/">article</a> on that), but as you know that web service supports JSON, JSONP comes to help.
</p>
<p>
JSONP is a JSON with padding (or it also called JSON with prefix). With JSONP you are specifying URL and callback function, like http://external.com/json?callback=f. This must be put into script tag.
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">&#60;</font><font color="#800000">script</font> <font color="#ff0000">type</font><font color="#0000ff">="text/javascript"</font> <font color="#ff0000">src</font><font color="#0000ff">="http://external.com/json?callback=f"</font><font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br><font color="#0000ff">function</font> f(data) {<br><br>}<br><font color="#0000ff">&#60;/</font><font color="#800000">script</font><font color="#0000ff">&#62;</font><br></font><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
It is allowed and works perfectly fine. 
</p>
<p>
But what if you need a dynamic calls? It is also not a problem, it is possible to create script tag dynamically and attach it to DOM. A nice way of doing that. I&#8217;ve seen in <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/github-api/blob/master/github.js">github-api</a> project. Original code is from here, I just removed some details and made it more reusable.  
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">(<font color="#0000ff">function</font> (globals) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> json = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__jsonp_callbacks: {},<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call: <font color="#0000ff">function</font> (url, callback, context) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> id = +<font color="#0000ff">new</font> Date;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> script = <font color="#0000ff">document</font>.createElement(<font color="#A31515">"script"</font>);<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;json.__jsonp_callbacks[id] = <font color="#0000ff">function</font> () {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete json.__jsonp_callbacks[id];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callback.apply(context, arguments);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> prefix = <font color="#A31515">"?"</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">if</font> (url.indexOf(<font color="#A31515">"?"</font>) &#62;= 0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefix = <font color="#A31515">"&#38;"</font>;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url += prefix + <font color="#A31515">"callback="</font> + encodeURIComponent(<font color="#A31515">"json.__jsonp_callbacks["</font> + id + <font color="#A31515">"]"</font>);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;script.setAttribute(<font color="#A31515">"src"</font>, url);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">document</font>.getElementsByTagName(<font color="#A31515">'head'</font>)[0].appendChild(script);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;globals.json = json;<br>})(window);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>

</p>
<p>
This code very useful for small &#8220;depends-on-nothing&#8221; applications. Of cause jQuery has its own support of JSONP, so as soon as you already using jQuery you should consider <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/">$.getJSON</a> for your needs.

It might seem that investment into UPS is a big deal.. as far as you lost a data after power outage.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I was in such situatation. Outage of power was only for 1-2 seconds, but it was enough to my PC. It turned off and after I turned it on again, BIOS was not able to detect my hard drives. I&#8217;ve got 2 drives on my PC, but none of them is detected.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve completed no fine diagnosis yet, and still hope that hard drives are OK or at least, I could restore something. Fortunately, last times I more use my notebook for work, so all latest information is there. On a PC I&#8217;ve got my all my old projects (with local SVN server, no backed up some service) a lot of books, photos and music. Photos would be the most painful thing to loose.  
</p>
<p>
You always can hear about importance of backup but does not take it seriously as soon it does not happen to you. It happened to me and now I feel not so great. For now I&#8217;m thinking of how to minimize or avoid such in future. For sure, spending about 200 bucks for UPS doesn&#8217;t sound bad idea now. I would also finally buy additional space on google to store all photos in picassa with original size, so you will always have a backup. All important projects, documents other artifacts, should be on copied on services (Google Docs, Google Code, github etc.). Music, videos and so on is backed up for external USB hard drive. Now, it is not so expensive.. and there is a chance that this hard drive could also be corrupted, but it is better than nothing.

Recently I&#8217;ve started my tiny project. For this project I required access to GitHub by it&#8217;s open API. Implementation were done in javascript, so I started to look for existing javascript frameworks that works with API. On GitHub API help page there is a link for such kind of framework, implemented by <a href="http://github.com/fitzgen">fitzgen</a>. I&#8217;ve opened repository and checked out a small javascript file called <a href="http://github.com/fitzgen/github-api/blob/master/github.js">github.js</a>. It was implemented very nice, accessing API via JSONP (something that I would avoid to implemented by myself, since I&#8217;m not very experienced in that). That was a good news!
</p>
<p>
But bad news was that current implementation lacks something that I require. Namely, Object API that is suppose to provide access to repository objects was missing. So, I&#8217;ve considered it as my change to do first fork!
</p>
<p>
Forking is very native to development with Git - as you would like to contribute to some project, you do fork, this will actually create a copy repository (or branch) you work with.. and if you commit something to your fork, you can give a notification to author. Author is the one who decides, is your changes worth to be included to master branch or not. Fairly simple. I&#8217;ve decided to implement Object part of API by my own, fortunately all infrastructure code was already done, so what I had to do is to learn specification and implement appropriate calls.
</p>

After I forked github-api repository Nick started to watch it.. so it was also like motivation factor to me. I did my first part of implementation and was ready to commit. Since my not great experience with javascript I was not really sure about my code and had a little worries about a feedback I could receive from author. But, no changes to step back! I&#8217;ve done commit and pull request to author. I was expecting for feedback and received it very soon! Despite of my worries Nick were quite happy on such contribution, moreover he did a very great review and provided my with results. So, after a some corrections we did a successful merge to master branch. I really liked that! Moreover, he helped me to clarify my opened questions regarding javascript and JSONP.     
</p>
<p>
That was really nice experience of collaboration within GitHub. I liked how it happens and I enjoyed that open source style of work.

It might be well known fact, but I just discovered it to myself. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> has a nice feature together with Chrome. If you looking for some information, just start typing stackoverflow.com in Chrome URL bar, as soon as Chrome will suggest you to use http://stackoveflow.com press tab and you will see a prompt to put your query. Just create your query and press enter and you will get results directly from StackOverflow site. It seems a very nice and useful feature, since I frequently use StackOverflow as source of information.

<p>As one of my favorite topics - tools that improve tests quality I would like to describe a <a href="http://site.typemock.com/test-lint">TestLint</a>. It is a rather new tool from famous TypeMock company, so as soon it has been announced I&#8217;ve immediately downloaded it.</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve used it couple of weeks and want to share what I liked:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>It is lightweight, easy to install</li>
<li>It easily detects a empty test cases. In such case it shows a warning near the case</li>
<li>Documentation says that it is <a href="http://site.typemock.com/creating-a-test-lint-rule/">extendable</a> by custom rules, but I haven&#8217;t tried it yes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What my initial feedback on it could be:
<ul>
<li>I would believe my tests are perfect, but &#8220;Empty&#8221; case if only one warning I saw from TestLint so far</li>
<li>Analysis is done on pre-build sources, so to get results you have to build you tests first</li>
<li>You can get analysis only by browsing a sources. It would be nice, if you can get all warnings in separate window</li>
<li>It would be nice to see all rules currently used in some UI</li>
<li>It would be nice if rules could be created not only by API but also through some interface</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, TestLint is free, it doesn&#8217;t crash your Visual Studio, it helps you to do better job in some way - there are no reasons not to install it! I would recommend it and waiting for next versions with improvements.

Programming has changed a lot thought last years, for sure. Solving a problem is no longer now, like sitting with a bunch of books or opened MSDN help and Visual Studio, trying a different approaches. It has began with specialized forums where developers shared the problems they met and expecting other developers to help them out. It worked. Maybe because of developers like to help someone by means of computer stuff, even if they could not talk to the person sitting next table. After, developers started to create personal blogs where written a problems and solutions they met every day. Google search helped a lot to get information from blogs.. and to make this information be helpful. So now, a term &#8220;solving a problem&#8221; turns to &#8220;googling a problem&#8221; and it is very likely that someone with blog, or someone in forum or group has already solved something similar. I hardly could image development now without google.. really.      
</p>
<p>
Web 2.0 bring a new type of communication and collaboration people in internet - social networks. Social networks might be a kind of evolution from forums and groups, but participants of social network has more personality in it (with a rich profile, photos and bio, ratings and so on) and a community around yourself (friends, colleagues, groups etc). If you friend of someone, you are tracking someone&#8217;s activities.. as current status, shared links, new audio or video clips and so on. Social network is so popular now, so I can bet that there no person who uses internet more than several month, who do not have an account in any social network. 
</p>
<p>
Have you ever hear a term &#8220;social coding&#8221;? If you try to google it you definitely be pointed to <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a>. GitHub is a social network, for developers. What developers need from social network? They need the same profiles as in common social network, with information, link to blogs etc, but developer is someone who supposed to produce a code and GitHub makes it possible to submit your code, so other people could see it and comment. GitHub is based on Git source control system. It has a lot of differences with more widely used Subversion and I would say Git is more complex and mature than Subversion. You have to spent some effort to switch your mind from Subversion to Git, but it not really hard to do.
</p>
<p>
Within your account you are creating a Repositories. You can have as many open repositories as you like, and you can submit any code you want. Repositories are main artifacts of network. In a Repository it is not only the source files you can store, but also it provides you with issue tracking system, binary storage for builds, wiki pages. That mean that GitHub could be also treated like a open source project management/development site like a <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/uk-UA/">Code</a> from Google or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a> from Microsoft or old good <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like any other networks it gives you ability to follow and be followed by other participants. Following means you are start to track all persons actions in GitHub, like creation of new repositories, commits, forks, code commentaries. You can also watch some particular Repository of someone, so you will track all changes that happens in repository. If you find something interesting and want to participate you can do a fork of repository (analog of branch in svn) commit to you fork and do a pull request to author, so he can review what you did and merge changed to master branch. Of all that is done nicely in GitHub, with a intuitive dashboard and tools. 
</p>
<p>
GitHub is implemented in Ruby on Rails in very popular in Ruby community. It currently hosts <a href="http://github.com/rails">Rails</a>, and lot of other Ruby project. Also, you will find <a href="http://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6">Linux-2.6 kernel</a> sources of <a href="http://github.com/git/git">git</a> itself.. and <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://github.com/repositories">many many more</a>.
</p> 
<p>
GitHub really bring something new into open source development world.
</p>
<p>
How I use GitHub? Ok, first of all - my blog articles are there. I have a special repository to store html, so I commit drafts and as soon as I&#8217;m ready I put html to my blogspot. All code examples and projects I show in my blog is also in GitHub, so if you would like to check the code you are just following the link I give in post and do that. I&#8217;m educating myself in ASP.net/C#/MVC/JavaScript and so on, so now I also put my tests project there.. so they are accessible in any machine with Git. I follow several persons to see what they are doing. My network is tiny yet.. but let&#8217;s see how it goes! 
</p>
<p>
If you liked idea&#8217;s of GitHub, please create your account and let&#8217;s join.
</p>
<p>
See you on network!

During implementation of Linq to SQL of Entities application you can see such exception:
</p>
<p>
<i>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException : MSDTC on server &#8216;SRV\5118CF33-D353-46&#8217; is unavailable.</i>
</p>
<p>
Generally it means that there are several transactions is being created in application and they have to be managed by a special service, called &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221; that is by default is not started. So, the quickest solution is just to start the service manually. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services and start &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221;. If it is required by your configuration you can set it as &#8220;Automatic&#8221; startup type, to run at as your server up.

<p>
But please be sure <b>what you are doing</b>, because this exception could also show some issues in application. As soon as it is appeared after some code changes, you have to clearly understand that involvement of Distributed Coordinator is expected behaviour. 
</p>
<p>
What happened to me with my Linq to SQL application is following: there are two 
    classes that create instance of DataModel class, first one is DbSetup that responsible for some preparation of data for tests, second is Repository object. DbSetup was also opening a TransactionScope object, to rollback all data that is being created during tests. This what created a problem - as soon as TransactionScope opened in scope of DataModel within DbSetup class, DataModel created in Repository was treated by runtime as a part of another transaction. That&#8217;s why runtime starting to request &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221; to manage transactions. So, in unit test code I changed the constructor of Repository to accept DataModel created in DbSetup as constructor argument, so only one &#8220;transacted&#8221; DataModel object used in application. That solved my problem, without starting up coordinator.

It could be analog of <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> for Ruby on Rails developers. So, Web Matrix is a tiny package including simple IDE, IIS Express, SQL compact edition and number of templates. It believe it will be used by bloggers and small size web site holders.
