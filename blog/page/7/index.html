<p>This is a high level overview of new stuff that appeared within VS2011 release. So, let&#8217;s briefly look inside. Today will take a look on changes appeared to Web API.<br />
</p><h2>Web API</h2><p>The biggest and most important change as for me is integration of Web API into ASP.NET. Web API is most known as WCF Web API - an attempt of .NET team build framework for creation of RESTfull services based on WCF infrastructure. There was several releases of WCF Web API made and general feedback from community was - &#8220;it&#8217;s good enough&#8221;. Since when, Microsoft did a strategic change, merged WCF Web API and ASP.NET teams together, so both products to be developed in sync. From now Web API is integral part of ASP.NET (and does not have any WCF prefix any more) and called ASP.NET Web API. It is not just re-branding, but it reflects changes both the programming model and processing architecture.<br />
</p><h2>Simple Start</h2><p>If we create a new ASP.NET MVC4 application, we see the following change into <code>global.asax</code> file.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">routes.MapHttpRoute(
    name: "DefaultApi",
    routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
    defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
);
</pre><p><code>MapHttpRoute</code> is new extension method for <code>RouteCollection</code>. Similarly to ASP.NET MVC routing definition, it maps HTTP request with matching URL into corresponding API controller action. By default, the are all prefixed with &#8220;api&#8221; to do not &#8220;interfere&#8221; to ASP.NET MVC routing. It&#8217;s not a problem to change that prefix to anything you want, like &#8220;services&#8221;, &#8220;methods&#8221; etc.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    /api/contacts/      <- Web API
    /api/contacts/1     <- Web API
    /contacts/1         <- ASP.NET MVC
</pre>
<p>The API controllers are really similar to ASP.NET MVC controllers. Instead of inherit from <code>Controller</code> class, they inherited from <code>ApiController</code> class. Instead of returning <code>ActionResult</code> from action, in API controllers you return either <code>IEnumerable</code> or concrete instance, like <code>Product</code> (there are some more dedicated scenarios with returning types, we will see later).
</p><p>By just looking into example from project template it is very easy to understand, what&#8217;s going on. There are some small details you should know before API controller usage.
</p><h3>Action methods naming</h3><p>API controllers are &#8220;Convention over configuration&#8221; based. The actual HTTP verb that action handles could be specified in method name.
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    // Handles GET
    public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; Get() { }
    // Handles POST
 public Product Post(Product product) { }
    // Handles PUT
 public Product Put(Product product) { }
    // Handles DELETE
 public void Delete(int id) { }
}
</pre><p>This convention applies only to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. You might be more specific in methods names, like <code>GetProducts</code> or <code>DeleteProduct</code>, the important is the prefix (Get, Post, Put etc.) of method.
</p><p>If you don&#8217;t want to rely of named based conventions, you can explicitly specify target HTTP verb by decorating methods with HttpGet, HttpPut, HttpPost, or HttpDelete attribute.
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; AllProducts() { }
    [HttpPost]
 public Product CreateProduc(Product product) { }
    [HttpPut]
 public Product UpdateProduct(Product product) { }
    [HttpDelete]
 public void DeleteProduct(int id) { }
}
</pre><h3>One handler per one controller</h3><p>API Controller are different from ASP.NET MVC controller. The main difference is that API controller handles exactly one HTTP request belongs to particular entity.
</p><p>If you try to create the code like:
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; Get() { }
    public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; GetAnother() { }
}
</pre><p>It would be build OK, but on a runtime if you try to access &#8216;/api/products&#8217;, you will get an exception:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">"Multiple actions were found that match the request: 
\u000d\u000aSystem.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1[MvcApplication7.Api.Controllers.Product] 
Get() on type MvcApplication7.Api.Controllers.ProductsController\u000d\u000aSystem.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1[MvcApplication7.Api.Controllers.Product] 
GetAnother() on type MvcApplication7.Api.Controllers.ProductsController"
</pre><p>The less stuff is very similar to something we get used in ASP.NET MVC. And you might think - why do we need this Web API at all, I can do exactly the same stuff with good-n-old ASP.NET MVC controllers? Not exactly. Web API has several killer features that makes it favorite for data oriented API&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s go on.
</p><h2>Content Negotiation</h2><p>Content Negotiation is the process for mutual agreement between client and server about the received/sent data formats. Good news here, Web API does a lot of job for you, leaving content negotiation internals behind the scene. Let&#8217;s take a brief look of how things happen.
</p><p>When client sends HTTP request to server, besides the query string and payload it also provides different kind information. This information is being placed into HTTP header and provides server with specific details for better understanding each other. In particular, it contains <code>Accept</code> header field which specifies client preferences on response format. I&#8217;m going use Fiddler to check how Web API behaves on different conditions.
</p><p>First, let&#8217;s do not specify the <code>Accept</code> field at all. So, the payload we going to send to server from our client (Fiddler) will be like:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    GET /api/products HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: Fiddler
    Host: localhost:5589
</pre><p>For that request, we will receive the response like:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Pragma: no-cache
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Expires: -1
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    X-SourceFiles: =?UTF-8?B?RDpcRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRcUHJvamVjdHNcZXhwZXJpbWVudHNcTXZjQXBwbGljYXRpb243XE12Y0FwcGxpY2F0aW9uN1xhcGlccHJvZHVjdHM=?=
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2012 17:31:23 GMT
    Content-Length: 88

    [{"Description":"iPad","Id":1,"Price":1000},{"Description":"iPhone","Id":2,"Price":500}]
</pre><p>As you can see, the default Content-Type is &#8220;application/json; charset=utf-8&#8221;, there is a json string in HTTP response payload.
</p><p>Let&#8217;s make our request a little more specific. 
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    GET /api/products HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: Fiddler
    Host: localhost:5589
    Accept: text/xml
</pre><p>The corresponsing response:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Pragma: no-cache
    Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
    Expires: -1
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    X-SourceFiles: =?UTF-8?B?RDpcRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRcUHJvamVjdHNcZXhwZXJpbWVudHNcTXZjQXBwbGljYXRpb243XE12Y0FwcGxpY2F0aW9uN1xhcGlccHJvZHVjdHM=?=
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2012 17:33:34 GMT
    Content-Length: 329

    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;ArrayOfProduct xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;&lt;Product&gt;&lt;Id&gt;1&lt;/Id&gt;&lt;Description&gt;iPad&lt;/Description&gt;&lt;Price&gt;1000&lt;/Price&gt;&lt;/Product&gt;&lt;Product&gt;&lt;Id&gt;2&lt;/Id&gt;&lt;Description&gt;iPhone&lt;/Description&gt;&lt;Price&gt;500&lt;/Price&gt;&lt;/Product&gt;&lt;/ArrayOfProduct&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, without any code changes we made it &#8220;adapt&#8221; for particular client needs. This is a very decent feature of Web API and available for use, just from the box. You even don&#8217;t need to care about it at all. Leave the content negotiation for the infrastructure.
</p><h2>IQueryable&lt;T&gt; Support</h2><p>Next cool feature is IQueryable&lt;T&gt; support. If you need to, instead of returning &#8220;plain&#8221; IEnumerable objects from the API action, you might return IQueryable&lt;T&gt;. Why?
</p><p>Remember the times we implemented paging & sorting with ASP.NET MVC application. It was possible of cause, but it required a lot of manual job. Actions had to be extended with additional parameters, code have to respect those parameters and return exact portion of data we require to. The same story with sorting. In Web API it much simpler.
</p><p>Change the signature and return type to IQueryable.
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public IQueryable&lt;Product&gt; Get()
{
    return _storage.AsQueryable();
}
</pre><p>Now, if Web API sees the method like that, it will allow to access with with Open Data Protocol (OData) query string parameters. OData provides support for following queries: $filter, $orderby, $skip, $top.
</p><p>Now, if I do the request:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    http://localhost:5589/api/products?$top=3
</pre><p>I will receive, 3 top products. Or something like,
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    http://localhost:5589/api/products?$skip=2&$top=3
</pre><p>I will skip 2 and take rest 3. In short, having IQueryable and 4 OData query parameters it&#8217;s much more easy to do the stuff required more time before.
</p><h2>Hosting</h2><p>Hosting is a feature of Web API allow to run service inside the different hosts. What does it mean?
</p><p>We are much get used to ASP.NET hosting as default. I saw no problem with that at all till working on one of my recent <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">projects</a>. The problem is for ASP.NET pipeline you need to have a web server (IIS), but web server always have some limitations (permissions and stuff). For simple things, that does not require any IIS benefits it is easier to host application just in .exe assembly. It&#8217;s now possible with Web API.
</p><p>We have several hosting providers out of the box: self-hosting and web-hosting. Besides of that there are already some provided by community <a href="http://whereslou.com/2012/02/20/gate-adds-owin-support-for-the-new-asp-net-web-api-beta">Louis DeJardin created a host on top of OWIN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pmhsfelix/WebApi.Explorations.ServiceBusRelayHost">Pedro Félix host for Azure</a>.
</p><p>Also, there is a great article by Pedro Felix about <a href="http://pfelix.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/asp-net-web-api-in-memory-hosting/">in-memory</a> hosting. This is very useful type of hosting for unit testing of services. 
</p><h2>IoC improvements</h2><p>Since Web API now is inside ASP.NET MVC, it uses the same strategy of resolving types by <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/10/inside-aspnet-mvc-idependencyresolver.html">IDependencyResolver</a>. That means that Web API classes are now supporting same IoC style as ASP.NET MVC controller classes. Being setup once you can put different dependencies inside API class constructor.
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
 public ProductsController(IServiceProvider service, IRepository&lt;Product&gt; productRepository)
 {
  // .. 
 }

</pre><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>This is not everything, but very light overview of new stuff coming within ASP.NET MVC4. ASP.NET Web API is very nice addition to framework. There are already some <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/155137/thoughts-after-using-asp-net-web-api-beta-in-anger-for-a-week">good</a> feedback, so let&#8217;s hope it will be even more improved toward release.

<p>29 February (leap day and huge failure of Azure Cloud) is the day then VS2011 Beta community preview has been released. As a lot of geeks around the globe I&#8217;ve downloaded installation image and tried it on my computer. With VS2011 Beta we also received .NET 4.5 framework and (drums here) - ASP.NET MVC4 Beta, that I really wanted to try since first CTP is out. I would not say I spent too much time with both products, but I already have some initial opinion on that.<br />
</p><h2>VS2011 installation..</h2><p>Well, I had some not really good experience with beta versions of VS2010 and compatibility between two visual studios on the same machine. Situation is different with VS2011. Installation very pretty smooth, I just run it on background while was working through RDP on another machine and it installed without any interaction. Whole process took about 40 minutes.<br />
</p><p>VS2010 and VS2011 beta could happily leave together without any interference. Moreover, you can freely work with your existing VS2010 solutions. Solutions for .NET 4, 3.5 and 2.0 are still supported in the same good way. <br />
</p><h3>.. and first launch</h3><p>VS2011 &#8220;cold&#8221; start up is a faster (about 40 seconds against 90 seconds, on my machine). The only one reason I see is VS2011 is not yet overloaded with different plugins I use in VS2010. <br />
</p><p>First very noticeable change is of cause the design. There were many blog posts with preview of VS2011 design before the beta release. And you know, I really liked what I saw on images. I changed my opinion on first launch. Probably it&#8217;s just the matter of taste or habits, but new VS design looks awful to me (especially in Dark Theme - 80&#8217;s monochrome display back!). It&#8217;s totally grey, with no colors in icons at all. Fonts are in METRO style (all uppercase) looks very unusual. Solution explorer contains grey icons, it&#8217;s a little difficult to distinguish between project types and file types inside. So, fellow developer - get ready to order new glasses since you decide to switch to VS2011.  <br />
</p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kD1OpPYEcJY/T2GxpBjYlQI/AAAAAAAAIB0/IApm8gGFf6k/s620/image-3.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kD1OpPYEcJY/T2GxpBjYlQI/AAAAAAAAIB0/IApm8gGFf6k/s620/image-3.png" style="width: 620px" alt="vs2011 solution" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>Nevertheless, I was happy to open my exiting solution, press Ctrl + Shift + B and it successfully built. The good thing is .sln file has not been transformed (except the <code>Format Version 11.00</code> has been changed to <code>Format Version 12.00</code>) so it&#8217;s still can be opened both VS2010 and VS2011. <br />
</p><p>It also has been imported all my VS2010 settings. It is really nice, since you don&#8217;t need to spent much time setting up favorite color scheme and key bindings.<br />
</p><p>I haven&#8217;t seen any noticeable performance changes. Sometimes VS2011 works a little slower as for me (please note, this is only subjective feelings, does not pretend to be absolute truth). Looks like VS2011 has much larger memory footprint.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GvxigiUfINs/T2GxpL273FI/AAAAAAAAIBw/FjTLSQN6KUQ/s800/image-1.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GvxigiUfINs/T2GxpL273FI/AAAAAAAAIBw/FjTLSQN6KUQ/s800/image-1.png" style="width: 620px" alt="vs2011 memory usage" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>And for some mystical reason it spawns second <code>devenv.exe</code> process in a while, even if I have only one VS instance running.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GMrPaWLfxxQ/T2GxpGYIY5I/AAAAAAAAIBs/wu29YT2sHfg/s854/image-2.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GMrPaWLfxxQ/T2GxpGYIY5I/AAAAAAAAIBs/wu29YT2sHfg/s854/image-2.png" style="width: 620px" alt="vs2011 spawns process" /><br />
</a><br />
<h3>Code editing</h3><p>Code editor is almost the same. No new refactoring tools, no support of 3rd parties Unit Test systems (NUnit, XUnit etc.) from the box.  Still Visual Studio requires to have ReSharper for more productive coding. My dream of using clean VS with minimum plugins installed seems not gonna come true with VS2011.  <br />
</p><p>Some few nice moments I noticed for HTML/Razor/CSS editors. First of all, it updates closing HTML tag if you changed opening one (and vice versa). For CSS, it has much more better InteliSence + nice feature of picking colors.   <br />
</p><p>I haven&#8217;t noticed any significant changes to JS editor. Except the fact, that there are no &#8216;Update JScript Intellisense&#8217; menu command, so I suppose that now it&#8217;s done automatically. Still, it&#8217;s very primitive and does not work all the time. For instance, I haven&#8217;t managed to get any InteliSense during working with Knockout.js library, maybe I&#8217;m just doing something wrong.<br />
</p><h3>I want my plugings</h3><p>So, VS2011 is generally OK, so I would prefer to use it. Hope a lot of new fixes and some feature still will be included in RC.<br />
</p><p>What I personally lack is 2 plugins. ReSharper and NCrunch. Fortunately both appeared very fast. Remco Mulder released <a href="http://www.ncrunch.net/download.htm">NCrunch 1.38b</a> and JetBrains are came with <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2012/03/resharper-70-eap-visual-studio-11-beta-edition-is-nowopen/">ReSharper 7 EAP</a> which is free for download and evaluation. Both plugins works really fine. Having good refactoring tools as ReSharper gives and having the power of Continuous Tests with NCrunch, makes the VS2011 ready to use IDE. <br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The beta looks very promising.. and in general it works fine! Except the design, nothing really new to IDE as for me. Probably I spent to few time to feel the power, so I&#8217;ll be updating if I see some cool or bad features. The most sweet things with new VS is surely updated .NET framework and MVC. I&#8217;m now trying to play with new stuff and much as I can, already checked some new nice stuff of MVC4 framework.<br />

As it was <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/03/my-first-year-in-company.html">last year</a>, this year e-conomic still plays very important role in my life, so I&#8217;ll spent some time to write this blog post.<br />
</p><p>Well, a lot of things changed I would say. Some people came, some people left. Teams rotating all the time, I&#8217;m no longer work with guys I used to work last year. We are doing revolutionary things there, no doubts. It doesn&#8217;t mean, we are creating new search engines or inventing new type of computer. No, we are revolutionizing ourselves much.. doing the same type of products, but doing it differently.<br />
</p><p>Remember I wrote about how <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/12/why-new-technologies-move-your-product.html">technologies helps to move product faster</a> - that was an example of radical changes in framework and tools we did to successfully deliver the product. I believe something happened last year, something that gave much pulse for changes. And that pulse still affects us. We went much further of changing for Web Forms to MVC or jQuery to Backbone.js. Recently our back-end team finished up POC of using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> + <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> as our perspective server side technology stack. And they actually proved that it will work for us. <br />
</p><p>From my perspective, e-conomic much improved in this year. And this is of cause happened, because people how work in e-conomic improved. Without any hesitate, I would say that currently we have the strongest team ever. Both Danish and Ukrainian parts. It&#8217;s amazing how smooth the technologies change was, how fast new concepts been adopted, how motivated and hardworking guys joined together. <br />
</p><p>We&#8217;ve been empowered not only by engineers, but also with our newly assembled UI/UX team. No secret, everybody want to work with beautiful things. I equally appreciate both the quality of code and quality of design. And this is want UI/UX team care about. And this is fantastic job as for me. We are changing the design quite regularly and each iteration it turns better and better. Colors, fonts, usability tricks - that&#8217;s something that gives a life to modern web applications.   <br />
</p><p>As usually the developers see only the tip of iceberg of whole company business, but I really hope that all good stuff that&#8217;s happening inside engineering department will find it&#8217;s reflection in quality of service, usability and user happiness.. that at the end of the day bring the company more users and more money. Sure, the things are moved not only by developers. I would say, we are doing the easiest job. Our PO&#8217;s and Stakeholders - that&#8217;s where ideas are coming from. The quality of those &#8220;ideas&#8221; are directly proportional to output quality. And this quality is getting better and better each day.<br />
</p><p>We are doing finishing strokes on new product, called <a href="http://debitoor.com/">Debitoor.com</a>. It&#8217;s amazing application and I hope it will find it&#8217;s audience very fast. <br />
</p><p>So, I&#8217;ll say goodbye to the past year and look forward for new journeys in next one.<br />

<p><a href="http://foundstyles.com/">Foundstyles.com</a> is a little project I&#8217;ve been working for last week. The idea is very simple. Remember, I blogged about <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/02/foundation-framework-for-web-sites.html">Foundation Framework</a> that works pretty nice for me. So, I&#8217;ve decided to do something similar that exist for twitter bootstrap framework - <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">bootswatch</a> ready to pickup .css that could be easily integrated to your site. Today the site is available!<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-U17a7t15HJI/T1dZpe6E4gI/AAAAAAAAIBQ/82EugHUbFLI/s1024/image-1.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-U17a7t15HJI/T1dZpe6E4gI/AAAAAAAAIBQ/82EugHUbFLI/s1024/image-1.png" alt="foundstyles.com" style="width: 620px" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>Unfortunately Foundation does not support LESS from the package, so I need to move colors and layout into corresponding .LESS files, so after it&#8217;s just possible to have a basic <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/foundstyles/tree/master/default">template</a> which is possible to customize with own colors.  <br />
</p><p>As for now, I&#8217;ve created only 3 templates: <a href="http://foundstyles.com/bladesofsteel/">Blades Of Steel</a>, <a href="http://foundstyles.com/evergreen/">Evergreen Tree</a> and <a href="http://foundstyles.com/coffeenmilk/">Coffee and Milk</a>.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y-jpR-k1dJ8/T1dZpkgbnDI/AAAAAAAAIBU/0GzBc1l-vWE/s1089/image-2.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y-jpR-k1dJ8/T1dZpkgbnDI/AAAAAAAAIBU/0GzBc1l-vWE/s1089/image-2.png" alt="foundstyles.com" style="width: 620px" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>I had a lot of joy making those styles. Making web designs and playing with colors is my next hobby, I think. Through, those styles are really simple ones, I&#8217;m going to add more eventually. Since the project is just hosted on <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/foundstyles">github</a> you are able to push you own styles. If you feel inspired, I would be really happy for submissions.<br />
</p><p>Nearest plans are apply some fixes for IE (both site and styles) and just go ahead and produce some more. Hope it could be useful for you guys.<br />

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/Code52/Ideastrike/pull/92">upgraded</a> IdeaStrike project from NancyFX 0.9 to the latest 0.10 version. There were some very unclear moments, fortunately due to great support of <a href="">@thecodejunkie</a> and <a href="">@grumpydev</a> they are solved. As a result, the <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/520">issue 520</a> was born, that contains a lot of text inside. I&#8217;ll try to sum up all important things into one blog post.<br />
</p><h2>Running update</h2><p>With NuGet updating dependencies is very easy, just run in package manager console:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    PM> update-package
</pre><p>It will give you the information about the upgrade process, it should be very smooth, so the end you will see:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">Successfully uninstalled 'Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet 0.9.0'.
Updating 'Nancy.Testing' from version '0.9.0' to '0.10.0' in project 'IdeaStrike.Tests'.
Successfully removed 'Nancy.Testing 0.9.0' from IdeaStrike.Tests.
Successfully removed 'Nancy 0.9.0' from IdeaStrike.Tests.
Successfully added 'Nancy 0.10.0' to IdeaStrike.Tests.
Successfully installed 'Nancy.Testing 0.10.0'.
Successfully added 'Nancy.Testing 0.10.0' to IdeaStrike.Tests.
Successfully uninstalled 'Nancy.Testing 0.9.0'.
The directory is not empty.

Successfully uninstalled 'Nancy 0.9.0'.
</pre><h2>Fixing compilation errors</h2><p>As you try to build the project after upgrade, it would fail because of compilation issues.<br />
</p><p>If you using Nancy bootstrapper and overriding <code>RequestStratup</code> method, you will see that method had changed the signature: <br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">    // in 0.9
    protected override void RequestStartup(ILifetimeScope container, IPipelines pipelines);

    // in 0.10
    protected override void RequestStartup(ILifetimeScope container, IPipelines pipelines, NancyContext context)
</pre><p>So, it now receives additional parameter - NancyContext.<br />
</p><p>Next compilation errors is inside the <code>Request.Headers.AcceptLanguage</code>. <br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">    // in 0.9
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; AcceptLanguage { get; }
    
    // in 0.10
    public IEnumerable&lt;Tuple&lt;string, decimal&gt;&gt; AcceptLanguage { get; }
</pre><p>Both of these compilation errors are really easy to fix. See changes to <code>src/Ideastrike.Nancy/IdeastrikeBootstrapper.cs</code> in this <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike/commit/a2bba73869292c076639d8b87a3d9d73cd97abf8">commit</a>.<br />
</p><p>After that, the compilation will be fine. I had to restart my Visual Studio after, since NCrunch was failing to compile the application. <br />
</p><h2>Fixing failing unit tests</h2><p>After VS is restarted and NCrunch able to pick up changes, I got 3 unit tests failures. All of them with the similar exception, like:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    System.Exception: System.Exception : ConfigurableBootstrapper Exception
    ---- Nancy.RequestExecutionException : Oh noes!
    -------- Nancy.ViewEngines.ViewNotFoundException : Unable to locate view '404'. Currently available view engine extensions: sshtml,html,htm,cshtml,vbhtml
    at Nancy.Testing.PassThroughErrorHandler.Handle(HttpStatusCode statusCode, NancyContext context)
    at Nancy.NancyEngine.CheckErrorHandler(NancyContext context)
    at Nancy.NancyEngine.HandleRequest(Request request)
    at Nancy.Testing.Browser.HandleRequest(String method, String path, Action1 browserContext)
    at Nancy.Testing.Browser.Get(String path, Action1 browserContext)
    at IdeaStrike.Tests.IdeaStrikeSpecBase1.Get(String path, Action1 browserContext) in D:\Development\Projects\Ideastrike\tests\IdeaStrike.Tests\IdeaStrikeSpecBase.cs:line 85
</pre><p>That was a mystery. All of those tests were fine, but suddenly stopped to work in 0.10. <br />
</p><p>The reason was very interesting. Those tests for views were actually <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/520#issuecomment-4157010">never run</a>. It&#8217;s been unseen for 2 reasons: Nancy 0.9 failed silently about missing view, IdeaStrike unit tests never tested view content.<br />
</p><p>To make those run, the <code>IdeaStrikeSpecBase</code> have to be setup with <code>IRootPathProvider</code>. IRootPathProvider, provides the path root for modules, so views could be located, based on default conventions. I finished up with this implementation:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class CustomRootPathProvider : IRootPathProvider
{
    public string GetRootPath()
    {
        return Path.GetDirectoryName(typeof(IdeastrikeBootstrapper).Assembly.Location);
    }
}
</pre><p>This root provider is used with spec base class configuration:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public IdeaStrikeSpecBase()
{
 Bootstrapper = new ConfigurableBootstrapper(with =&gt;
 {
  with.Module&lt;TModule&gt;();
  with.Dependencies(_Users.Object, _Ideas.Object, _Features.Object, _Activity.Object, _Settings.Object, _Images.Object);
  with.DisableAutoRegistration();
  with.NancyEngine&lt;NancyEngine&gt;();
  with.RootPathProvider&lt;CustomRootPathProvider&gt;(); // <- Here
 });
}
</pre>
<p>So, we are saying that root is the same folder as IdeaStike assembly. The problem is that location depends on actual Test runner. In case of NCrunch, it would be some deeply hidden folder in user\AppData\Local\Temp, in case of ReSharper runner it would be temp ASP.NET folder. That&#8217;s a little annoying.
</p><p>Tests were still red, since neither NCrush nor ReSharper is copying actual views into target folder. Fortunately, I found this great <a href="http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/01/03/testing-rendered-output-of-nancyfx-with-the-razor-view-engine-gotchas/">article</a>, explaining NancyFX view testing gotchas. I ended up with just saying “Copy if newer” for views under test, so they are in the same folder as target binary. That&#8217;s not cool, but currently I see no other option.
</p><p>After those changes, tests became green, so I run the application. No surprise, it failed to start.
</p><h2>Fixing runtime errors</h2><p>At the first run, I got nothing more as bunch of Razor compilation errors:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    Error Compiling Template: (51, 18) The name 'Url' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (61, 33) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (68, 26) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (78, 7) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (83, 31) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (88, 14) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (103, 14) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (118, 14) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (132, 25) The name 'Model' does not exist in the current context)
    Error Compiling Template: (234, 19) The name 'Url' does not exist in the current context)
</pre><p>The proposed <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/520#issuecomment-4153006">solution</a> that NancyRazorViewBase should always be specified with generic parameter.
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">    // in 0.9
    @inherits Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor.NancyRazorViewBase

    // in 0.10 
    @inherits Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor.NancyRazorViewBase&lt;dynamic&gt;
    &ensp;
</pre><p>OK, that helped a little, but right after that error saying <code>System.Web.IHtmlString</code> type is not references:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    Error Compiling Template: (83, 1) The type 'System.Web.IHtmlString' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Web, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.)
</pre><p>NancyFX is being developed to be independent of <code>System.Web</code>. It was not totally true for 0.9 with Razor support, but it has been fixed in 0.10. That of cause, brings some surprises. So, if your application is using Razor view engine, you need to do <a href="">following</a>:
</p><ul>    <li>update all usages of IHtmlString to use Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor.IHtmlString</li>
    <li>update all usages of McvHtmlString to use Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor.NonEncodedHtmlString</li>
    <li>let the razor engine know about system.web (in case if HttpContext is used in layout)</li>
</ul><pre class="brush: plain">&lt;razor disableAutoIncludeModelNamespace=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;assemblies&gt;
        &lt;add assembly=&quot;System.Web, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/assemblies&gt;
    &lt;namespaces&gt;
        &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Web&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/namespaces&gt;
&lt;/razor&gt;
</pre><h2>Changing the Partial views</h2><p>After these steps were done, application finally started. But some page gave runtime exception:
</p><pre class="brush: plain">Server Error in '/' Application.

Sequence contains no elements

Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. 

Exception Details: System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no elements
</pre><p>My dump analisys showed, that it works fine as soon as I removing partial views:
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">    @Html.Partial("Shared/Templates/upload.html")
    @Html.Partial("Shared/Templates/download.html")
</pre><p>The reason turned out to be really <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/issues/520#issuecomment-4179548">simple</a>. All templates in IdeaStrike project were using .html extension. For 0.10 it required to be .cshtml. So, renaming from .html to .cshtml made the IdeaStrike up and running again.

<p>It&#8217;s been great weekend. It started Friday evening with Kiev ALT.NET <a href="http://blog.kievalt.net/post/17767271242/ncrunch-nancyfx-fubumvc-event">meet-up</a> which been in idle for a while and everybody missed that. There was a three planned speeches: by <a href="http://twitter.com/_TLK">@_TKL</a> on Continuous Testing (NCrunch, MightyMoose), NancyFX framework by me and FubuMVC by <a href="http://twitter.com/skalinets">@skalinets</a>.<br />
</p><p>I would not say I got great experience on Nancy so far. But I&#8217;m pretty exited on frameworks features and super-dupper-happy-path. Almost all knowledge I gathered thought hacking of <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike">IdeaStrike</a>, listening to Herding Code <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=350">episode</a> and reading <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Documentation">documentation</a>. But anyway, I believe it turns out to be good introductory presentation.   <br />
</p><script src="http://speakerdeck.com/embed/4f47e42f8448db0022000bf4.js"></script><br />
<p>Right after my Nancy talk I moved to central train station, since I was about to visit <a href="http://www.ciklum.net/join/community/Ciklum-NET-Saturday-25-02/">Ciklum .NET Saturday</a> in Dnepropetrovsk. .NET Saturday&#8217;s is just great initiative by Ciklum company. I&#8217;s free event, everybody welcome, content is usually nice. I highly recommend to follow their events. <br />
</p><p>I had two talks there. First one about &#8220;Continuous Delivery&#8221; that I did on <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/01/agile-base-camp-2012.html">Agile Base Camp 2012</a>. Besides of the talk I also did a quick and improvised demo of <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">Candidate</a> application. Even if I had some technical issues the demo went fine.<br />
</p><p>Another one is for logging and tracking unhandled exceptions in ASP.NET / ASP.NET MVC application based on ELMAH. I showed some basics features as well easiness of ELMAH integration to ASP.NET MVC with <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH.MVC</a> NuGet package. It was very light and funny talk, especially discussing Troy Hunt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html">ELMAH attack</a>. <br />
<script src="http://speakerdeck.com/embed/4f49e9bd2270a2002200a29c.js"></script><br />
<p>I also really much enjoyed <a href="http://samarskyy.blogspot.com/">Anton Samarskyy</a> talk on jQuery deffered objects and Vitaly Koval did great hacking session of WinRT.<br />
</p><p>I some of you been listening to me on those speeches and still have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me by comments or through <a href="http://twitter.com/alexbeletsky">twitter</a>. See you next time!<br />

<p>The <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> framework is something I discovered by accident browsing through some github project pages. I really liked how one of the sites looked on my iPad. I was also pleased to see how HTML crafted, using clear names for classes and HTML5 semantics. As it turned out, that site was using Foundation Framework by <a href="http://www.zurb.com/">Zurb</a> - design agency in San Francisco Bay area.<br />
</p><p>I checked out the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/">documentation</a> and Foundation appears to be pretty solid framework for web applications prototyping and production. It contained everything needed: <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/grid.php">Grid Layouts</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/buttons.php">Buttons</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/forms.php">Forms</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/ui.php">UI</a>. And of cause, all of that is open source hosted on github.<br />
</p><p>During my preparation of project page for <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">candidate</a> I decided to try it out. I was really happy of the experience. <br />
</p><h2>Object Oriented CSS</h2><p>Have you heard of <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a>? Initially I thought that idea is almost non-sense, but I&#8217;m changing my opinion now. I think Foundation fully conforms to OOCSS style of development - each behavior or UI you want to apply to HTML element is done by applying of corresponding class. <br />
</p><p>Great thing is that you see how it&#8217;s done in framework and do same in your code as well. I remember the times I started to do HTML/CSS and I higly used #id&#8217;s, applying the styles by element Id. The code was awful and styles applied on #id&#8217;s were not re-usable at all, so if I needed the same margin/padding or text color I have to copy the section of CSS and move it into next <code>#some-id { ... }</code>.<br />
</p><p>With OOCSS you rely on classed. Here some example,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class=&quot;container darker-grey light-border small-padding&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;row smaller-fonts&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p>Look, no #id&#8217;s - classes only. With classes I control: position, colors, borders and margin/paddings. This is really cool, since all of that classes are easy reusable in any part of page.<br />
</p><h2>Grid system</h2><p>Grid systems is really cool concept and allows to develop much faster. Instead of writing own CSS that would position elements, you stick to Grid System. The classical grid system is probably <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a>. It&#8217;s really great and blown my mind as I first time tried it, but currently it little outdated: 960px wide is small for modern monitor and it is not adaptive. Modern web design demands site looks great both on PC and Mobile devices, adapt it&#8217;s content based on screen size.<br />
</p><p>Here is a quote of Foundation documentation.<br />
</p><blockquote>The grid is built around three key elements: containers, rows, and columns. Containers create base padding for the page; rows create a max-width and contain the columns; and columns create the final structure. Everything on your page that you don&#8217;t give a specific structural style to should be within a container, row and column.<br />
</blockquote><p>You develop the layout based on planned number of row and columns that compose the row. Again, code is done in OOCSS way with clean classes names, so you write almost &#8220;plain&#8221; English in HTML.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
      Eight columns
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;four columns&quot;&gt;
      Four columns     
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p>After design is ready, you just open it on iPad and.. Surprise, it looks great there! Text and columns are adaptively fits the screen size. <br />
</p><h2>Buttons and Forms</h2><p>Buttons and Forms are same important as Colors and Fonts in your web site. You can&#8217;t get good site appearance if buttons and forms are ugly. I usually spend a lot of time on &#8220;beautifying&#8221; those, but still unhappy with results at the end of the day. With Foundation it&#8217;s easier. You got nice styles from the box. <br />
</p><p>Forms:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-r0XbF8NN5Zo/T0NfEXYwg6I/AAAAAAAAH4Q/4yZ8y3OqCMM/s620/image-1.jpg"><br />

</a><br />
<p>Buttons:<br />

</a><br />
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/pull/313">submitted</a> green button style, so I hope it will be available soon.<br />
</p><h2>UI stuff</h2><p>Besides those primary things you got nice bonus. That&#8217;s different UI elements commonly used through different web sites. It includes: Alerts, Labels, Warnings, Tooltips, Tabs etc. <br />
</p><p>For <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">candidate</a> site I successfully used Pagination UI element. <br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_5240sOGkko/T0NfHuydwUI/AAAAAAAAH4g/jE3ft2nAAeM/s620/image-3.jpg"><br />
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_5240sOGkko/T0NfHuydwUI/AAAAAAAAH4g/jE3ft2nAAeM/s620/image-3.jpg" alt="foundation ui" /><br />
</a><br />
<h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Currently <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> from Twitter is obvious leader in that niche. But I really think Foundation will get it&#8217;s place. Easy to use, great documentation <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation">repository</a> is very active, so we might expected further great features in Foundation.<br />
</p><p>And by the way.. To payback Foundation, I got idea for small product: inspired by <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> I&#8217;m about to create bunch of &#8220;ready-to-use&#8221; Foundation themes, that you just download and start to use immediately. It will work great for people who are about to create one page product presentation or simple blog. Hope it will go fine and I release it soon.<br />

<p>  You may notice that I stick to original project name at the end of the day, even thought I wish to change it. That happened for 2 reasons: first, I really get used to candidate and it&#8217;s good enough project name.. second, I spent some hours of brainstorming but found out nothing better that existing.<br />
 </p> <p>  This weekend I also finally concluded project web site and hosted it as github pages - <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/</a>. So, ladies and gentlemen - please welcome, <a href="https://github.com/downloads/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/candidate-v.0.0.1rc.zip">Candidate v0.0.1rc</a> is ready to be shown to the world. <br />
 </p> <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/"><br />
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WIUMqyz3naI/TznyBp-dQbI/AAAAAAAAH4A/exqlfJUQr8o/s1024/screenshot-1.jpg" alt="candidate web site" style="width: 620px;" /><br />
 </a><br />
 <h2>  What&#8217;s the goal?<br />
 </h2> <p>  Thinking about nearest &#8220;competitors&#8221; in this area I would re-call <a href="http://www.paulstovell.com/octopus/intro">Octopus</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/paulstovell">Paul Stovell</a>. Octopus uses Build Server / Tentacle (Agent) architecture principal, while Candidate is simple Agent architecture - you host it the same machine as your environment is (stage, production) providing both integration and deployment functionality.<br />
 </p> <p>  My goal is stabilize and improve Candidate through this year, so it fulfill different requirements including performance and scalability. I switched all my projects to use Candidate now, so it would give me some initial feedback.<br />
 </p> <p>  Nevertheless, Candidate may turn out to be a powerful deployment application I&#8217;m still thinking about &#8220;Deployement as Service&#8221; product like <a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHabor</a> and <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> as it was <a href=
  "http://www.beletsky.net/2011/06/candidatenet-application-i-made-on.html">original</a> idea.<br />
 </p> <h2>  What&#8217;s next?<br />
 </h2> <p>  Following the principle &#8220;Build product X to learn technology Y&#8221; I&#8217;m going to proceed with Candidate to shape following areas that I wish to improve now:<br />
 </p> <ul>  <li>Processes, threads, synchronization in .NET</li>
  <li>Async, Tasks library</li>
  <li>Robust applications architecture</li>
  <li>Different deployment scenarios for .NET platform</li>
 </ul> <p>  Technological stack is still ASP.NET MVC3 / C#/ jQuery. Currently application requires to be hosted on IIS, with application pool Process Identity equals to Admin. This does not suite all users. So, I&#8217;m looking forward to create self-hosted version using <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy">NancyFX</a>. <br />
 </p> <p>  I also try to target UI / UX issues as much as possible.<br />
 </p> <h2>Wanna join?</h2> <p>  I would be happy to. I&#8217;ll much encourage you to download application, install it, perform simple testing (scenario could be found <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/wiki/Quick-start-instructions">here</a>). Let me know what you think, that would be great initial contribution. As for any github hosted project, you are absolutely free to fork, hack it out and send pull request.<br />
 </p> <p>  Thanks for you help.<br />

      <div class='post'>
<p>First of all, I have to say <a href="">Code52</a> team is doing just amazing job. It&#8217;s very original initiative, cool ideas and highly productive team. Each time they announce next thing to build I have &#8220;product envy&#8221; inside me. Check out their <a href="">blog</a> or <a href="">github</a> account to be updated.<br />
</p><p>My attention this time was attracted by <a href="">IdeaStrike</a> project. It suppose to be analog of <a href="">uservoice</a> for OS community. As always, first release was very fast and I was very curious what&#8217;s inside. So, I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/Code52/Ideastrike">repo</a> and did small hacker session. I&#8217;ve spend some hours with it and would like to share some initial thoughts.<br />
</p><h2>Build script is small and clean</h2><p>Project contains <code>build.cmd</code> as I run it downloaded all dependencies by NuGet, build web site and run all unit test. Basically, all you need for any small project. Then I looked inside, it turns out like:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">@echo Off
set config=%1
if "%config%" == "" (
   set config=Debug
)

%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild build.proj /p:Configuration="%config%" /t:AppHarbor /m /v:M /fl /flp:LogFile=msbuild.log;Verbosity=Normal /nr:false
</pre><p>At the time I first looked in it also contained small script for running tests, but later they moved that to .csproj as separate target. <br />
</p><h2>Use NuGet without committing to SCM</h2><p>I was amazed, how fast git repository was cloned and as I checked out <code>packages</code> folder with all dependencies were just empty. How can it be? As I said in #1 as I run build script they just automatically downloaded for me. As it turns out, this is feature of NuGet that allows to work with dependencies, without real necessity of committing those to SCM. This is very cool, especially if you have big project, so cloning and branching appears to be prolonged operations. The implementation details is on <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages">nuget</a> site.<br />
</p><h2>Deploy application DB at first launch</h2><p>IdeaStrike is based on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2012/01/12/ef-4-3-beta-1-released.aspx">EF 4.3 Beta 1</a> currently, using Code First approach. EF Code First also includes very cool feature called Migrations. This is something I really lack first time I tried EF Code First approach. You define the  <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike/blob/master/src/Ideastrike.Nancy/Models/IdeastrikeContext.cs">Context</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike/blob/master/src/Ideastrike.Nancy/Migrations/IdeastrikeDbConfiguration.cs">DbConfiguration</a> class and <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike/tree/master/src/Ideastrike.Nancy/Migrations">migration scripts</a> (that&#8217;s also, just a C# code), so at application bootstrap you call the code like:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">private static void DoMigrations()
{
    var settings = new IdeastrikeDbConfiguration();
    var migrator = new DbMigrator(settings);
    migrator.Update();
}
</pre><p>The database and schema will be automatically deployed on first application run.<br />
</p><h2>Social login with Janrain</h2><p>As I clicked to Sign In button, I&#8217;ve been showed nice dialog to select my existing social account to login. <br />
</p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eJTIkFUrCtA/TzQNiXlAayI/AAAAAAAAH34/gFt_Gn8vAME/s620/image-1.jpg"><br />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eJTIkFUrCtA/TzQNiXlAayI/AAAAAAAAH34/gFt_Gn8vAME/s620/image-1.jpg" alt="social login" /><br />
</a><br />
<p><a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/engage-introduction?utm_source=login.janrain.com&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=attribution">JanRain</a> is very cool solution. I remember I tried to investigate something like that for ASP.NET MVC and was really disappointed, because I actually found nothing. For all of existing solutions you have to read OAuth spec and write own code. JanRain does all dirty job for you. As user authorized you receive POST on given URL, with a special token. By given token you request the details about the user, like name and email and so on (see <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Ideastrike/blob/master/src/Ideastrike.Nancy/Modules/LoginModule.cs">LoginModule.cs</a>). It has fair <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/pricing">plans</a> for hobby projects and bloggers.<br />
</p><h2>Bootstrap your CSS and HTML</h2><p><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> neither new nor very unique, at least I know several good CSS/HTML frameworks. But IdeaStrike proved one more time - it has no sense to invent the wheel. Take advantage of results produced by people who are smarter than you, that&#8217;s the rule of pragmatic programmer.<br />
</p><p> Dear future me, please never ever again start your application with HTML/CSS from scratch, you can build nothing more as shit. Bootstrap is great for different kind of projects and prototypes. Taking into account number of watches and forks on <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/">github</a> I expect even more improvements and features in future. <br />
</p><h2>Nancy as web framework</h2><p>I&#8217;ve heard about Nancy many times, but it&#8217;s only now I got a change to touch it. For me it&#8217;s just alternative reality comparing to ASP.NET MVC. It is not hard to understand what the code does. It is not hard to apply changes there. You are very explicit of what you are doing, by specifying HTTP verb, route and action as lambda. First class citizen in Nancy is Module, all module&#8217;s logic is placed inside the constructor:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public FeatureModule(IIdeaRepository ideas, IFeatureRepository features, IUserRepository users)
    : base("/idea")
{
    _ideas = ideas;
    _features = features;

    this.RequiresAuthentication();

    Post["/{idea}/feature"] = _ =>
    {
        int id = _.Idea;
        var feature = new Feature
                        {
                            Time = DateTime.UtcNow,
                            Text = Request.Form.feature,
                            User = Context.GetCurrentUser(users)
                        };
        _features.Add(id, feature);

        return Response.AsRedirect(string.Format("/idea/{0}#{1}", id, feature.Id));
    };
}
</pre><p>Nancy application could be hosted as ASP.NET / WCF / Self hosted runtimes, it supports different View Engines (including Razor). In short, it is great ALT.NET tool and will find a lot of applications in different projects. More details on <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy">Nancy</a> github account.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>IdeaStrike is great example of open source project you can learn something from. I would not say I got only positive impressions, moreover there are some obstacles that block me from my normal development flow. I&#8217;ll try to share my observations on next blog posts.<br />
</p><p>NancyFX, probably be my next web framework to learn, since I need to move out of ASP.NET MVC which is comfortable zone for me now. I&#8217;ll be keep looking for IdeaStrike and hope to do some pull requests as well.<br />

<p>Recently my TDD arsenal has been enhanced with 3 new cool tools, which I&#8217;m about to share with you. More precisely it one tool and two frameworks. Let&#8217;s go for it.<br />
</p><h2>NCrunch<br />
</h2><p><a href="http://www.ncrunch.net/">NCrunch</a> is just amazing extension for Visual Studio created by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/remcomulder">@remcomulder</a>. It automatically detects all your tests and re-running those as soon as source code changes happen. Forget about manual test re-running, it&#8217;s just waste of time. You even do not need to press Ctrl + S, just continue coding as you usually do. <br />
</p><p>Initially I had big doubts about such kind of tools, but NCrunch changed my mind. It supports major unit test frameworks NUnit, XUnit, MSpec etc. Besides of that it allows to collect code coverage metrics (and show it just in VS editor), run tests under debugger, supports multi-core systems etc.<br />
</p><p>In short, NCruch is something that makes your TDD very smooth, allowing to focusing on important things and forgot about some routine.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SG_xDY5wvDo/TypXmx-VFGI/AAAAAAAAH3o/S46jODLRr5Q/s620/image-1.jpg"><br />
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SG_xDY5wvDo/TypXmx-VFGI/AAAAAAAAH3o/S46jODLRr5Q/s620/image-1.jpg" alt="ncrunch" /><br />
</a><br />
<h2>NSubstitute<br />
</h2><p>I stick to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a> for quite awhile and saw no reason to switch it.. Till I saw <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com/">NSubsitute</a>. I hardly could imagine someone who staring &#8220;yet another mocking framework project&#8221;, it looks like absolute non-sense.. But <a href="https://github.com/nsubstitute">those</a> guys proves me wrong.<br />
</p><p>Well, what&#8217;s so new there? First of all it have very clean API. No more <code>new Mock()</code> or <code>MockGenerator.GenerateMock()</code>, creation of test doubles are nothing more as <code>Substitute.For&lt;IEntityToMock&gt;()</code>. Mocking properties, multiple return values, events etc. in very easy fashion. Check out their <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com/help/getting-started/">getting started</a> materials for further info. <br />
</p><p>Best feature as for me, that by using extension methods they got rid of lambdas for setting up mocks. It makes test code more readable and clean. See this small <a href="https://gist.github.com/1722396">gist</a> there I placed just some Moq and NSubstitue tests together.<br />
</p><p>I would not say that Rhino or Moq is now much worse that NSubstitute.. No, I would just say NSubstitute is a little better. Even same functionality, with less amount of code is already big argument for me.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">[Test]
public void should_send_an_email_if_users_signs_up_nsub()
{ 
 // arrange
 var emailService = Substitute.For&lt;IEMailService&gt;();
 var controller = new LoginController(emailService);

 // act
 controller.SignUp(new SignUpModel { Email = &quot;a@a.com&quot;, Password = &quot;xxx&quot; });

 // assert
 emailService.Received().SendEmail(Arg.Any&lt;EmailMessage&gt;(), &quot;current&quot;);
}
</pre><h2>FluentAssertions<br />
</h2><p>Again, for years I followed classic NUnit&#8217;s <code>Assert.That()</code> method. I also played a bit with <a href="http://sharptestex.codeplex.com/">SharpTestsEx</a>, but FluentAssertions by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ddoomen">@ddoomen</a> is going to change that.<br />
</p><p>FluentAssertions are based on extension methods and allows you to get rid of Assert.That call and just wrote your assertion directly to object. Here some example: <br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">{
    // NUnit.Assert style..
    Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(3));

    // FluentAssert style..
    result.Should().Be(3);
}
</pre><p>This is very simple example. The power of FluentAssertions arise then you need to have either multiple assertions or assertions on complex objects. Multiple assertion could be combined by <code>And</code>, like:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">{
    "somestring".Should().Contain("some").And.HaveLength(10);
}
</pre><p>It also provides great support for working with Collections, DateTimes, Guids, Exceptions, XML etc. Project is hosted on codeplex, here is <a href="http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/documentation">documentation</a>. Easy start, easy go.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Now, I&#8217;m sharpening my axe on those tools and have very nice impressions so far. Special thanks goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/skalinets">@skalinets</a> who introduced me with those tools.<br />
