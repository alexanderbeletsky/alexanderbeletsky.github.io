    <p>        It&#8217;s the first Saturday of New Year, so it would be good idea to spend some time thinking of year that passed.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Work in e-conomic</h2>    <p>        That was yet another great year in e-conomic. We have build great app - <a href="https://debitoor.com/">Debitoor</a>. Along the way, we were trying different approaches, re-writing things from scratch, designing and re-designing again and again. Finally we got very solid application built upon Node.js, MongoDB and Backbone.js. Debitoor has been created with scalability in mind, we started with Heroku cloud service, eventually moved to Amazon EC for back-end and Amazon Cloud Front for front-end. Now, it&#8217;s working amazingly fast and for 8 month we gathered ~20,000 signups, launched service for many countries.<br />

    <p>        Recently, I&#8217;ve been working on small project which I want to share here. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone.computedfields">Backbone.ComputedFields</a> and it&#8217;s small plugin that extends Backbone.Model functionality a bit.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I needed to have a model with &#8216;virtual&#8217; fields. Namely, fields that does not belong to model directly, but being computed based on some other fields values.<br />

    <p>Previous time, we&#8217;ve implemented a Backbone model and wrote some meaningful tests for it.<br />
</p><p>Next very important Backbone&#8217;s entry to test is View.<br />
</p><p>Views are central concept in framework. Views are actually ones who do stuff. We don&#8217;t have Controller in Backbone, but according to Controller <a href="http://www.itu.dk/courses/VOP/E2005/VOP2005E/8_mvc_krasner_and_pope.pdf">initial idea</a> as user input handler, Backbone views following exactly the same architectural goal, so they could be treaded as controllers in some way. <br />
</p><h2>What to test?</h2><p>You should focus on such things: <br />
</p><ul><li><strong>Initialization</strong> - test that view is provided with all required inputs like: model or collection, localization texts, different options. If view is not able, say, render without some option, you should test that exception is thrown.</li>
<li><strong>Rendering </strong> - test that required html appeared in view. I do not create those very strict, since they would be to fragile in case of markup changes, but still I check for major DOM elements are present and have right styles.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - test that view is correctly handle DOM events.</li>
<li><strong>Model changes and persistence</strong> - test that changes in view are correctly propagated in model. If view is about to persist the model, that could tested as well.</li>
</ul><p>I see tests of views as kind of integration test. You communicate to DOM, listening to events, updating models or changing DOM elements state. It&#8217;s typically that view tests are catching most regression issues.<br />
</p><h2>How to test?</h2><p>Fortunately, the Backbone views are designed in very testable way. You don&#8217;t need any special HTML on test page, since view holding all it&#8217;s DOM structure inside <code>this.el</code>. By means of jQuery, it&#8217;s easy to change DOM values or trigger events.<br />
</p><p>Since view also holds reference to model, it&#8217;s easy to check model&#8217;s attributes changes or spying on particular models methods.<br />
</p><p>First red test,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('FeedbackFormView.js spec', function () {
    var view, model;

    beforeEach(function () {
        view = new FeedbackFormView();
    });

    describe('when view is constructing', function () {

        it ('should exist', function () {
            expect(view).toBeDefined();
        });

    });
    </pre><p>Here we basically testing, that FeedbackFormView should exist, so as soon as function is in place, test should be green.<br />
</p><p>FeedbackFormView could not exist without a model as well as default feedback text, that should be used as initial value of textbox. In the language of TDD, that means:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('when view is initialized', function () {

    describe('without model', function () {

        it('should throw exception', function () {
            expect(function () {
                new FeedbackFormView();
            }).toThrow(new Error('model is required'));
        });

    });

    describe('without default feedback', function () {
            
        it('should throw exception', function () {
            expect(function () {
                new FeedbackFormView({model: new Backbone.Model() });
            }).toThrow(new Error('feedback is required'));
        });
    });

});
    </pre><p>To turn from Red to Green, let&#8217;s add <code>initialize</code> function to view,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">initialize: function (options) {

    if (!this.model) {
        throw new Error('model is required');
    }

    if (!(options && options.feedback)) {
        throw new Error('feedback is required');
    }

    this.feedback = options.feedback;
},
    </pre><p>Btw, after that change it&#8217;s required to fix previous test, since it start to fail.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('FeedbackFormView.js spec', function () {
    var view, model;

    beforeEach(function () {
        view = new FeedbackFormView({model: new Feedback(), feedback: 'TDD is awesome..' });
    });

    describe('when view is constructing', function () {

        it ('should exist', function () {
            expect(view).toBeDefined();
        });

    });
    </pre><p>Now, let&#8217;s test how rendering works.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('when view is rendered', function () {

    beforeEach(function () {
        view.render();
    });

    it ('should email field be empty', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('input#email')).toHaveValue('');
    });

    it ('should website field be empty', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('input#website')).toHaveValue('');
    });

    it ('should feedback field with default feedback', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('textarea#feedback')).toHaveValue('TDD is awesome..');
    });

});
</pre><p>Here and after I&#8217;m using very nice Jasmine plugin, called <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">jasmine-jquery</a>. It adds a number of matchers, very useful for testing jQuery objects.<br />
</p><p>We&#8217;ve tested initialization and rendering, now let&#8217;s test last aspect, model changes and persistence.<br />
</p><p>Suppose a user inputs nothing, erases default feedback and presses submit button. Expected behavior is expressed with this test:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('when form is submitted', function () {

    describe('no inputs are filled', function () {

        beforeEach(function () {
            view.$el.find('#email').val('').trigger('change');
            view.$el.find('#feedback').val('').trigger('change');
        });

        beforeEach(function () {
            view.$el.find('#submit').trigger('click');
        });

        it('email field should be invalidated', function () {
            expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.email')).toHaveClass('error');
        });

        it('feedback field should be invalidated', function () {
            expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.feedback')).toHaveClass('error');
        });

        it('website field should be valid', function () {
            expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.website')).not.toHaveClass('error');
        });

    });
</pre><p>That&#8217;s cool. After those tests are passing, we can test that if only email is filled, but feedback is still empty, we are not able to submit the form. By analogy of previous test,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('only email field filled', function () {

    beforeEach(function () {
        view.$el.find('#email').val('a@a.com').trigger('change');
        view.$el.find('#feedback').val('').trigger('change');
    });

    beforeEach(function () {
        view.$el.find('#submit').trigger('click');
    });

    it('email field should be valid', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.email')).not.toHaveClass('error');
    });

    it('feedback field should be invalidated', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.feedback')).toHaveClass('error');
    });

    it('website field should be valid', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('.control-group.website')).not.toHaveClass('error');
    });

});
</pre><p>And finally, if view is filled correctly,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">describe('email and feedback filled', function () {

    beforeEach(function () {
        spyOn(view.model, 'save').andCallThrough();
    });

    beforeEach(function () {
        view.$el.find('#email').val('a@a.com').trigger('change');
        view.$el.find('#feedback').val('some feedback').trigger('change');
    });

    beforeEach(function () {
        view.$el.find('#submit').trigger('click');
    });

    it('should show no errors', function () {
        expect(view.$el.find('.error').length).toBe(0);
    });

    it('should save model', function () {
        expect(view.model.save).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });

});
</pre><p>Here, we test 2 things: first, that no validation errors appeared on form and second that <code>save</code> method of model is called. Jasmine built-in spy framework is used here. You can setup on any function of any object and then verify that function has (or has not) been called.<br />
</p><p>I&#8217;m skipping the implementation of that view, but you can find the code of application in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4330928">gist</a>.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>While you typically start with defining and testing models in your application, view is integration test that helps to test actual behavior of application, depending on model states and events. You should define how &#8220;deep&#8221; you want to test the view, but my proposal is to focus on initialization, rendering, changes (validation) and persistence.<br />

      <div class='post'>
    <p>        It&#8217;s been to years ago, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/11/ive-release-my-own-product-trackytnet.html">released</a> my own project - Trackyt.net. Month ago I&#8217;ve cancelled my VPS lease contract, so your would not see it available at <a href="http://trackyt.net">http://trackyt.net</a> anymore.<br />
    </p>    <p>        This project is first attempt to release something. I had some pet projects before, but never ever made them done. Trackyt.net started as simple application to learn some JavaScript programming and HTML. It turns out to be much, much, much more. Even it seems to be very simple, but I&#8217;ve spent a lot of energy on it.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C1oDnTeZXIY/ULoMUOx3XPI/AAAAAAAAMuc/3GuIq-ra1UI/s1366/image-1.png"><br />

    </a><br />
    <p>        The product did not gather any meaningful amount of users neither good amount of traffic. For almost 2 years I was investing money/time on it. So, from the first sight it might appear as failed project.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Any kind of business should be evaluated in terms of assets. It&#8217;s not necessarily means money. Or more correctly, it does not meant &#8220;direct&#8221; money. I had no paying customers and I actually never thought to sell the product. But, I can prove it - every hour I spent on the project got back to me as value. And the most valuable asset for developer is skill, of cause.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OLeITq9xGf4/ULoMUBovQkI/AAAAAAAAMuU/lk7SvXWvvFc/s1086/image-2.png"><br />

    </a><br />
    <p>        I&#8217;ll try to analyze what actually happened:<br />
    </p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Web development and design:</strong> even my professional involvement into web applications, did not give me a feeling of web development. I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/03/aspnet-developers-disease.html">blame</a> ASP.NET Web Forms for that, but I realized that I lack that kind of skill. That was my first project were I did everything by myself, all HTML/CSS/JS were handmade, not stupid WebControls. My eyes opened on how many things I did not understand, how difficult the front-end might be. Crafting of UI is a huge pleasure for me, I simply like beautiful things. 2 years after I will never call Trackyt.net beautiful, but it was a great point to start.<br />
            <p>                <i>Outcome</i>: I overstepped the uncertainty and fears of front-end. During the JavaScript programming. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of value in front-end MVC frameworks, so I had no doubts of moving from jQuery based apps to Backbone.js (or other MV*) frameworks. I did a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/alexanderbeletsky">several speeches</a> of JavaScript applications development and got really cool feedback on it.<br />
            </p>        </li>
        <li><strong>Test driven development:</strong> practicing TDD for quite long years already, so Trackyt.net was not my first project were I applied the technique. The difference was that usually the we work with some legacy code at work, so TDD could be difficult to apply. Starting that project I had strong opinion on TDD and literally TDD&#8217;ed everything. UI, Controllers, Repositories.. JavaScript and C#. That was so great experience, I never felt on any other projects. During Trackyt.net I think I moved from <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">Shu</a> to <a href="</a>&#8220;>Ha</a> level of testing. Now, I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/11/develop-with-tests.html">more clearly</a> see what and when should I test to stay in good shape of application.<br />
        </li>
        <p>            <i>Outcome</i>: currently I&#8217;m professional TDD trainer at <a href="http://xpinjection.com/">XP Injection</a> and Trackyt.net much influenced that it happened. I share my experience with guys I show some examples of code there. I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/TDD">wrote</a> a bunch of blog posts on TDD and it&#8217;s Trackyt.net who gave most inputs and insights. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/12/testing-rest-services-with-javascript.html">implemented</a> integration tests for my API based FuncUnit and that blog post became the part of <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a> and still remains one of the best reads in my blog. I&#8217;ve learned UI testing and <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/04/functional-tests-must-not-be-done-first.html">formed</a> my opinion on that.
        </p>        <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC:</strong> Never used ASP.NET MVC before, I armed with <a href="http://books.google.com.ua/books/about/Pro_ASP_NET_MVC_2_Framework.html?hl=uk&id=lFSPoYt9deAC">great book</a> by Steven Sanderson I&#8217;ve started to learn new framework. And Trackyt.net was main playground. Starting up with MVC2 and lately ported it to MVC3 I had a chance to play different aspects of framework. ASP.NET MVC was my first serious step into web development world.<br />
        </li>
        <p>            <i>Outcome:</i> I became a huge fan of this technology, learning it from deep and <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/InsideMVC">posting</a> information on it. I had a few speeches about ASP.NET MVC.. and the biggest one on MS SWIT 2012, there ~300 persons were listened to me. Then the company I worked to were deciding about back-end technology for API of new product I helped to integrate ASP.NET MVC into existing web site and we successfully built API on it. I assisted my team mates to understand the framework, it was not difficult at all, since I knew the stuff. Currently I have a <a href="http://xpinjection.com/trainings/mvc-net-development/">training course</a> on ASP.NET MVC as well and already conducted some.
        </p>        <li><strong>API oriented architecture:</strong> popularized by Twitter and GMail, the architecture and having RESTfull JSON based service behind and the JavaScript-driven application on front-end, was my high-level architecture for Trackyt.net. <br />
            <p>                <i>Outcome:</i> I successfully used the same ideas on other projects and it worked really well. For now I&#8217;m consulting few companies that tries to adopt same ideas. The most popular <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/01/implementation-of-rest-service-with.html">post</a> in my blog is about build REST(like) services with ASP.NET MVC. <br />
            </p>        </li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> being annoyed by manual update of production environment I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/05/continuous-production-make-it-work.html">built</a> simple continuous delivery pipeline that worked really great for me. During the way I&#8217;ve met such great tools as Jenkins, UppercuT, RoundhousE etc. That was my first try of this approach and I felt huge power and advantages of Continuous Delivery. Slightly it became one of the professional areas of interests for me.<br />
        </li>
        <p>            <i>Outcome:</i> Continuous Delivery and <a href="https://github.com/chucknorris">Chuck Norris</a> tools was the topic of my first talk on <a href="http://kievalt.net/">KievALT.NET</a>. Since then I became an active participant of community and I really like it. Also, I&#8217;m talking about things like RoundhousE on my other speeches and trainings and I got a lot of pleasure than people stand by saying: &#8220;You know, we&#8217;ve tried that and it worked so nice, thanks a lot&#8221;.
        </p>        <li><strong>Code base:</strong> the code base of application is rather small. There is C#, JavaScript, SQL and some NAnt scripts. A lot of things I used there I still copy and paste (or at least taking a look) from Trackyt.net to my current projects. It became a kind of cook book, from there I could quickly pick up some recipe. <br />
        </li>
        <p>            <i>Outcome:</i> I didn&#8217;t thought above that initially, but Trackyt.net codebase also helping me to see what improvements I&#8217;ve made so far. For instance, I reviewed the API controllers recently and realized that I would never write anything like that. Having some code that you produced year or two ago you peer and compare gives some really interesting insights. Besides of application code itself, I&#8217;ve made an C# API adapter and the most significant outcome is <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc">ELMAH.MVC</a>.
        </p>    </ul>    <p>        Concluding this, I would say - Trackyt.net changed the things radically. I&#8217;ve became a speaker on <a href="http://kievalt.net/">KievALT.NET</a> and <a href="http://xpinjection.com/uadevclub/">UADevClub</a> communities, my blog received an <a href="http://java.dzone.com/users/alexanderb">MVB</a> status, I improved my skills and knowledge and I do trainings and consulting. Basically, I&#8217;ve &#8220;rebooted&#8221; developer inside me and saw my way of constant learning and improving.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Looking back I definitely say - it was only possible because of Trackyt.net.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Without any doubts, that was the most successful project to me!<br />

    <p>Good news, <a href="http://kievalt.net/">Kiev ALT.NET</a> community! One of the best know ALT.NET developers <a href="http://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> is visiting us on December 11. It&#8217;s been awhile since the last meetup we had, so it&#8217;s just great time to gather again and listen to the presentation Jimmy prepared for us.<br />
</p><p>There will be a talk with intriguing name <i>&#8220;Real World Polyglot Persistence&#8221;</i>. Here is the short description of it.<br />
</p><blockquote>It always sounds easy - &#8220;use the best tool for the job&#8221;. With very isolated systems, it&#8217;s easy to decide RDBMS for one application, Redis for another and Cassandra for somethings else. When it comes time to building systems with multiple persistent stores, we&#8217;re met with challenges in integration, existing applications, and push back from IT administrators. In this session, we&#8217;ll look at the multitude of challenges of achieving polyglot persistence nirvana, and strategies for addressing associated risks.<br />
</blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but for me it sound extremely interesting.<br />
</p><p>Meetup will take place in <a href="http://ciklum.net/">Ciklum</a>, the most spectacular place in Kiev - <a href="http://www.ciklum.com/upload/iblock/41b/Ciklum_SkyPoint_Kyiv_20Floor.jpg">Sky Point</a> at 19-00. As always, <a href="http://ciklum.net/">Ciklum</a> happily agreed host us. <br />

    <p>        Pair programming is very known as efficient technique of writing code. Originally appeared as one of key XP practices, it got a lot of traction. You can find many publication about Pair Programming and seems everybody clearly understands it&#8217;s value. Being a XP trainer and visiting conferences related to engineering practices I usually see such situation: the question goes to the crowd &#8220;How many of you do practice Pair Programming?&#8221; and I can give a bet, only few hands will appear.. very few people are actually practicing Pair Programming. Why?<br />
    </p>    <p>        Because Pair Programming is damn hard!<br />
    </p>    <p>        There could be 2 situations with PP: first one, then both guys are completely different levels of skills - it turns to be that one (more experienced) is writing and thinking all the time, another one is almost watcher helping to find a grammar errors in code comments. At the end of the day you got 2 mans powers producing 1 mans power work. Easy journey.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Second one is different, is then 2 guys are same or equally same level. Working in such pair could be compared to wresting. You literally have to fight to move on. All the time you under pressure of another man&#8217;s opinion, usually strong one. You struggle much to get consensus on different topics. You are talking all the time and arguing all the time. Sure, you got shinny-working-super-cool results much more faster by working such pair. <br />
    </p>    <p>        But there is a problem - after 3-4 hours of working that way you will be completely exhausted. Believe me, you are absolutely useless after 4 hours session of true Pair Programming. Thinking, focusing, arguing, writing, testing, debugging over and over again. It takes a lot of energy. Working a 40 hours week in strong pair will let you feel like 80 hours week. There is also psychological side as well: 2 persons could not match each over, so working in pair would be like hell. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Pair programming takes double effort. You should not plan PP session for a whole day, half day as maximum. In my opinion it&#8217;s not valuable to do every task in pair, simply it&#8217;s not productive. Pick up most difficult ones, ones that requires cross-functional expertise or most risky ones. As problem well kick-started, rest of things might go in parallel. <br />
    </p>    <p>        I really like Pair Programming, but I would not use it as day-to-day practice as XP suggests. Most of the time, it&#8217;s more efficient to work alone.<br />

<p>            Unit testing is important part of development process. If you care about the application state and code quality, sooner or later you start to automate the tests. My experience shows, sooner is better option. There are several approaches to unit testing, `test-first` and `test-after`. There are many holy wars appears on that topic. I would say, both options works - but `test-first` or test driven development, works better for me. <br />
        </p>        <p>            By the end of the day, it&#8217;s only important that tests exists and helping to catch regression bugs. Still, developing by `test-first` helps to see the problem before ahead and in general provides better code quality (that would conclude the holy war). <br />
        </p>        <p>            Today we going to write some tests, that would cover our existing model class <code>Feedback.js</code>. Since the code is already written, we will go `test-after` approach. Fortunately, the code is quite simple, so it would not make a problem to unit test that. But before, let&#8217;s setup our testing infrastructure.<br />
        </p>        <h2>Folders and files</h2>        <p>            We&#8217;ll have a new folder called `spec`. Inside the spec folder, I&#8217;ll have `models` and `views` folders that would contain tests for models and views.<br />
        </p>        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ey7odJOnLXM/UK3wux_CNDI/AAAAAAAAMIY/B0lXl2K_cDM/s620/image-1.png"><br />
            <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ey7odJOnLXM/UK3wux_CNDI/AAAAAAAAMIY/B0lXl2K_cDM/s620/image-1.png"/><br />
        </a><br />
        <h2>Tests runner</h2>        <p>            I&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> test framework. It&#8217;s very easy to setup it, what we need is <code>jasmine.js</code> and <code>jasmine.css</code> to be placed on proper folders and setup a test page. Test page is a simple html file, which will be entry point for our testing. If you download jasmine <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/downloads">standalone bundle</a> you will see <code>SpecRunner.html</code> inside. It could be easily tailored for custom needs.<br />
        </p>        <p>            In the head part of <code>tests.html</code> we need to reference all required .css and .js files.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: html">&lt;title&gt;Feedback form specs&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;content/jasmine.css&quot;&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/jquery-1.7.2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/underscore.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/backbone.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/jasmine.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/jasmine-html.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/libs/mock-ajax.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Sources --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/src/models/Feedback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Specs --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/scripts/spec/models/Feedback.spec.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>        <h2>Jasmine tests in essence</h2>        <p>            Testing with Jasmine is fun and easy. Jasmine is BDD-style framework, so if you practiced TDD with another frameworks, the style might confuse initially. Let&#8217;s review the Jasmine test skeleton.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: js">describe('Jasmine spec', function () {
    var value;

    beforeEach(function () {
        value = 1;
    });

    it ('should fail', function () {
        expect(value).toBe(0);
    });

    describe('when value is changed', function () {
        beforeEach(function () {
            value = 0;
        });

        it ('should pass', function () {
            expect(value).toBe(0);
        })
    });
});
</pre>        <p>            In this example, <code>value</code> is our SUT (System under test). <code>beforeEach()</code> function is `context-establish` function, where SUT is initialized (in TDD it&#8217;s both arrange/act). <code>it</code> function is assert part. Here, we set our expectations about which state should SUT be in to. Notice, that <code>beforeEach</code> are nested into <code>describe</code>, so you tweek SUT depending on case.<br />
        </p>        <h2>Writing some tests</h2>        <p>            The only one functionality that <code>Feedback.js</code> model contains currently is validation. Let&#8217;s test that.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: js">describe('Feedback.js spec', function () {
    var model;

    beforeEach(function () {
        model = new Feedback();
    });

    describe('when model is validating', function () {
        var errors;
    });
});
</pre>        <p>            This is something to start with. It does not do any asserts, so now we&#8217;ll add some real cases. First case, is than both `email` and `feedback` attributes are absent.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: js">describe('when email and feedback fields are absent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        errors = model.validate({});
    });

    it ('should have 2 errors', function () {
        expect(errors.length).toBe(2);
    });

    it ('should have email fields as invalid', function () {
        expect(errors[0].name).toBe('email');
    });

    it ('should have feedback field as invalid', function () {
        expect(errors[1].name).toBe('feedback');
    });
});
</pre>        <p>            It&#8217;s is possible that user put email, but forgot about feedback.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: js">describe('when email is set, but feedback is absent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        errors = model.validate({ email: 'a@a.com'});
    });

    it ('should have 1 error', function () {
        expect(errors.length).toBe(1);
    });

    it ('should have feedback field as invalid', function () {
        expect(errors[0].name).toBe('feedback');
    });

    it ('should have error message', function () {
        expect(errors[0].message).toBeDefined();
    });
});
</pre>        <p>            Moving on, user might put feedback but forgot about email.<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: js">describe('when feedback is set, but email is absent', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        errors = model.validate({ feedback: 'TDD is awesome'});
    });

    it ('should have 1 error', function () {
        expect(errors.length).toBe(1);
    });

    it ('should have email field as invalid', function () {
        expect(errors[0].name).toBe('email');
    });

    it ('should have error message', function () {
        expect(errors[0].message).toBeDefined();
    });
});
</pre>        <h2>Tests report</h2>        <p>            If you now try to run <code>test.html</code> in browser, you will something like that.<br />
        </p>        <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-K9NtZKm7pso/UK3wvG3mDxI/AAAAAAAAMIc/kQL0Ai1XX_A/s620/image-2.png"><br />

        </a><br />
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>        <p>            Testing of Backbone.Model&#8217;s is pretty simple thing. It&#8217;s nothing more than testing some business logic, that might reside inside. Testing of views is a bit trickier thing, but we will see how to do that next time.<br />

<p>        There are different approaches of how to create object in JavaScript. C# and Java programmers are commonly starting with creation by new operator, since it very close to same practice they got used to.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">function Person (name) {
    this.name = name;
}

var person = new Person('John Smith');
console.log(person.name);
    </pre>    <p>        If you try to run this code, you will see &#8216;John Smith&#8217; in console. Now, try to delete new operator.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Instead of &#8216;John Smith&#8217; you will see undefined. Why?<br />
    </p>    <p>        The difference is that without new operator it is just function call. During the call `this` points global namespace. If you running the code in browser, global namespace is bind to `window`.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It&#8217;s important to understand how new operator works. Internally, operator new is converted to NEW(Person, &#8216;John Smith&#8217;);. It does several things.<br />
    </p>    <ol>        <li>Creates new native object and initializes the __proto__ of object by function.prototype.</li>
        <li>Calls function, applying newly created object as value for <code>this</code>.</li>
        <li>Returns newly created object.</li>
    </ol>    <p>        It can be expressed in this kind of pseudo-code:<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">function NEW(f) {
    var obj = { '__proto__': f.prototype };
    f.apply(obj, arguments.slice(1));
    return obj;
}
</pre>    <p>        (It&#8217;s a bit more complex actually, for details check this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6750880/javascript-how-does-new-work-internally">great answer</a> on SO).<br />
    </p>    <p>        It means that during function call with `new operator()`, <code>this</code> always points to a new object, created based on function prototype. You can initialize the properties of new object inside the function. It&#8217;s no longer a simple function, but it is constructing function, or more simply - constructor.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To distinguish between constructors (that are always supposed to be called with `new`) and simple function, there is a convention to name a constructors with capital first letter (not person(), but Person()), just to give you some tips while you writing the code.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Knowing NEW() details of work and following simple conventions for constructors will help you to understand language better and prevent many stupid errors.<br />

    <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH MVC 2.0.2</a> has been just pushed recently. This is a contribution by <a href="https://github.com/jamescrowley">James Crowley</a> which adds a special configuration key that prevents ELMAH.MVC to setup a global `HandleErrorAttribute()`. It&#8217;s in particular useful, than you already setup some configuration inside the app, so you don&#8217;t want default behavior.<br />
</p><p>Inside the <code>web.config</code> file you will find a configuration setting for that.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">&lt;appSettings&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.disableHandler&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.disableHandleErrorFilter&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.requiresAuthentication&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.allowedRoles&quot; value=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.route&quot; value=&quot;elmah&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
    </pre><p>It is <code>elmah.mvc.disableHandleErrorFilter</code>. By default it&#8217;s `false`, meaning `HandleErrorAttribute()` from ELMAH.MVC is used. To disable it, just set <code>true</code> to this setting.<br />
</p><p>And btw, it&#8217;s already 30.000 downloads of NuGet package! Huge number, thanks a lot for all users and contributors.<br />

      <div class='post'>
    <p>        Let&#8217;s go back for a moment for <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/10/baby-steps-to-backbonejs-starting-up.html">previous</a> post where we started to bootstrap some basic Backbone.js application. It&#8217;s very simple now, just gathering all data and posting those data to server.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Any reliable system is almost impossible without validation. If some field is required or must conform to some particular rule, it should be validated as soon as possible and validation information should be displayed to user. User then applies corrections and re-submit data.<br />
    </p>    <p>        In case of `Feedback` model, we are interested that user always input her email and feedback message. Backbone.js provides very straight forward for models validation. If model requires validation, it should implement <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Model-validate">validate</a> method.<br />
    </p>    <p>        So, let&#8217;s extend our model with validate method.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var Feedback = Backbone.Model.extend({
    url: '/feedback',

    defaults: {
        'email': '',
        'website': '',
        'feedback': ''
    },

    validate: function (attrs) {
        if (!attrs.email) {
            return 'Please fill email field.';
        }
        if (!attrs.feedback) {
            return 'Please fill feedback field.';
        }
    }
});
    </pre>    <p>        As you can see, in case of email or feedback is missing, we just simply return string with error message.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To better understand what&#8217;s going on, let&#8217;s look on some piece of the code from Backbone.js framework. Namely, to `_validate` method of `Backbone.Model`, which is actually responsible for validation.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">_validate: function(attrs, options) {
    if (options.silent || !this.validate) return true;
    attrs = _.extend({}, this.attributes, attrs);
    var error = this.validate(attrs, options);
    if (!error) return true;
    if (options && options.error) {
       options.error(this, error, options);
    } else {
        this.trigger('error', this, error, options);
    }
    return false;
}
</pre>    <p>        You can see, if `validate` returns either undefined or null or false, `_validate` just returns true - meaning the model is valid. Otherwise, it would check if `options.error` function initialized and call it, if not model event `error` is triggered.<br />
    </p>    <p>        During the model saving, we typically provide both success and error callbacks. It means, that error callback will be called, if model does not pass validation requirements. Inside the callback, we might decided what to do with errors. Right now, let&#8217;s just do alert.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var options = {
    success: function () {
        alert('Thanks for the feedback!');
    },
    error: function (model, error) {
        alert(error);
    }
};

var feedback = {
    email: this.$('#email').val(),
    website:  this.$('#website').val(),
    feedback: this.$('#feedback').val()
};

this.model.save(feedback, options);
    </pre>    <p>        Notice that `error` callback receiving model itself as first argument and error object (one returned from `validate` method) as second argument. Let&#8217;s try this code: leave email and feedback fields empty and press submit button.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BtV9yCmh3T8/UJtgc5Nk4CI/AAAAAAAALnQ/d671woxZwrE/s621/image-1.png"><br />

    </a><br />
    <p>        There are several drawback of such implementation, though. First of all, `alert` windows are awful, second if user corrects email, next time she presses the submit button next alert with another message appears. This is terrible UX, so let&#8217;s fix it.<br />
    </p>    <p>        So, we should basically do 2 things: aggregate all errors during validation and apply some nice styles to errors.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Instead of returning simple strings, we&#8217;ll return an array of objects, containing name of failed and field and message.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">validate: function (attrs) {
    var errors = [];

    if (!attrs.email) {
        errors.push({name: 'email', message: 'Please fill email field.'});
    }
    if (!attrs.feedback) {
        errors.push({name: 'feedback', message: 'Please fill feedback field.'});
    }

    return errors.length > 0 ? errors : false;
}
</pre>    <p>        Change the `save` method options, to show errors if any error appeared and hide errors if save was successful. <br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var me = this;
var options = {
    success: function () {
        me.hideErrors();
    },
    error: function (model, errors) {
        me.showErrors(errors);
    }
};
</pre>    <p>        And implement 2 simple methods:<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">showErrors: function(errors) {
    _.each(errors, function (error) {
        var controlGroup = this.$('.' + error.name);
        controlGroup.addClass('error');
        controlGroup.find('.help-inline').text(error.message);
    }, this);
},

hideErrors: function () {
    this.$('.control-group').removeClass('error');
    this.$('.help-inline').text('');
}
</pre>    <p>        Let&#8217;s test the code. As all fields are left empty, it will look like,<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qPbTz5Cl0N4/UJtgc8JU-1I/AAAAAAAALnU/ru1sJb6j6V4/s717/image-2.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qPbTz5Cl0N4/UJtgc8JU-1I/AAAAAAAALnU/ru1sJb6j6V4/s717/image-2.png"></img><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        As fields are filled and form submitted, all errors are cleared from form.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        That was very simple &#8220;baby-step&#8221; style of approaching model validation. I would could it, validation &#8220;from the box&#8221;. Even if it&#8217;s very useful there are a lot of different approaches of making even things better. The source code is availble on <a href="https://gist.github.com/4037415">github</a>.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Stay tuned for next Backbone.js baby steps soon.<br />
