As you started to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uppercut">UppercuT</a> for your builds, it is definitely worth to try worth to try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/">RoundhousE</a> for versioning, deployment, migration of your database. 
</p>
<h2>RoundhousE - setup and usage</h2>
<p>
Let&#8217;s begin, just to to project web site and download latest package. Package contains documentation (just some draft version, not yet completed), samples and framework itself.
</p>
<p>
Initially I spent sometime to make samples run. Documentation said that it has been developed and tested with SQL 2008 Server and there is no information that it would run on SQL 2008 Express Edition. After several fail/repeat sessions I was happy to see that it actually could work with Express edition as well!
</p>
<h3>Before you start</h3>
<p>
Before you start, you have to change something in you SQL Express configuration. Go to <code>Start -> All programs -> Microsoft SQL Server 2008 -> Configuration Tools -> SQL Server Configuration Manager</code>. There you have to configure your SQL instance Network Configuration, to be able with &#8220;Named Pipes&#8221; protocol. So, go to <code>Protocols for &#60;%INSTANCE_NAME%&#62;</code> and enable <code>Named Pipes</code>
</p>
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TMbwcl2QFnI/AAAAAAAAG-8/ZK_EGoi0q5k/s1600/sqlconfig.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 301px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TMbwcl2QFnI/AAAAAAAAG-8/ZK_EGoi0q5k/s400/sqlconfig.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532373566257895026" /></a>
<h3>UppercuT configuration</h3>
<p>
Now you have to change something into UppercuT config. First you have to modify <code>LOCAL.settings</code> (file that is used for generation of deployment scripts). You have to supply <code>server.database</code> (in case of local Express it would be .\SQLEXPRESS), <code>database.name</code> the name of your db. 
</p>
<p>
After small changes is required for <code>UppercuT.config</code>. First, <code>folder.database</code> I just used &#8220;db&#8221;, short and clear.
</p>
<p>
Check out this <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Trackyourtasks.net/commit/552895c301426ad413d83eb9c5c7ef00cf8c52a6#diff-7">diff</a>, for instance.
</p>
<h3>DB folder layout and content</h3>
<p>
Now, you have to create folder that would contain all sql scripts. I places it in the same level as <code>docs</code>, <code>lib</code> etc (but it could be placed to <code>src</code> folder as well). So, please folder with name &#8220;db&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Documentation currently lacks information about folder layout, but from samples it is pretty clear:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>functions</strong> - sql for functions definitions</li>
<li><strong>permissions</strong> - setup permissions for database</li>
<li><strong>sprocs</strong> - stored procedures definition</li>
<li><strong>up</strong> - update scripts (create, drop, alter tables and records here)</li>
<li><strong>views</strong> - views definition</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your application doesn&#8217;t currently use stored procedures or view.. it is OK to just leave those folders empty.
</p>
<h3>Deployment options</h3>
<p>
You have 3 options of deployment: by Nant, by MSBuild or by RH executable. It does not actually matters what to choose, all options are equal by its functionality. I choose executable, because it lightweight and only one file (please not that it would be included to deployment package).
</p>
<p>
To go with RH you have to copy it from RoundhousE packages into yours deployment folder. So, you will have <code>deployment/rh/rh.exe</code>.
</p>
<h3>Correction of deployment scripts</h3>
<p>
Deployment scripts are ones that will be used on production to update database. They are created based on templates and settings you set. You have to modify yours <code>DBDeployment.bat</code> file. Since I use <code>rh.exe</code> I created template for it. It simply runs <code>rh.exe</code> that does the rest of work. 
</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/645211.js"> </script>
<p>
Check out this <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Trackyourtasks.net/commit/552895c301426ad413d83eb9c5c7ef00cf8c52a6#diff-7">diff</a>, for instance.
</p>
<h3>Running RoundhousE</h3>
<p>
As soon as build application, go to <code>code_drop</code> folder you can run <code>LOCAL.BEDeployment.bat</code> and RounhousE will setup database with version it.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s basically it! As soon as its configured you can easily add new scripts to db folder, RoundhousE will handle changes of them.
</p>
<h3>Additional scripts I use</h3>
<p>
There are something that I added for my personal needs. If I do build on new environment, I would like to create database first. For such purpose I created <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Trackyourtasks.net/blob/master/initdb.bat"><code>initdb.bat</code></a>, so build procedure on clean environment would be:
</p>
<ol>
<li>run build.bat</li>
<li>run initdb.bat</li>
<li>run test.bat all</li>
</ol>
<p>
I also created script to reset database,  <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Trackyourtasks.net/blob/master/resetdb.bat"><code>resetdb.bat</code></a> drops existing database and just creates new instance. This very useful during development, if you database became &#8220;dirty&#8221;.

I like open source tools and frameworks, but more I like open source tools and frameworks that work! There are 2 nice frameworks that I started to use really fast got exactly what I need. They are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uppercut">UppercuT</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/">RoundhousE</a>. I&#8217;ve planned to blog about both, but post appears to be quite long, so I&#8217;ll spilt it on two.
</p>
<p>
It is all about build and deployment. I&#8217;ve seen different build and deployment system through my career: some domestic made, some commercial, some simple, some complex. I&#8217;ve recently started to think about for my own project. But before we started, lets make it clear - what I personally expect from build framework?
</p>
<ul>
<li>It have to use a industry standard tools - nant, msbuild, nunit, ncover etc.</li>
<li>Build have to be done by one click (press key)</li>
<li>During build unit tests have to run</li>
<li>During build different code metrics must be collected</li>
<li>It have to be integrated with popular SCM systems - svn, git, perforce etc.</li>
<li>It must have easy to use versioning system, all build artifacts (binaries, docs) are labeled with one consistent version</li>
<li>It must have automatic packaging mechanism, to deploy package on target machine</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are having database in your application, you should also be concerned of.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Versioning of database</li>
<li>Deployment of database on any environment</li>
<li>Updating live database with new patches</li>
</ul>
<p>
Initially I thought to do some very simple by myself, but later I was browsing some repositories on github and noticed interesting project structure - build/deployment folders as well as number of batch files, like build.bat, test.bat, open.bat etc. I digged a bit and found out that it is actually scaffold provided by UppercuT. After I checked some documentation, I realized that it is probably something that I need! So, please met two projects that would simplify your life a bit: UppercuT - automation build/versioning/packaging; RoundhousE - db migration/versioning/deployment. 
</p>
<h2>UppercuT setup and usage</h2>
<p>
Just go to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/uppercut">UppercuT</a> web site and download latest package. I&#8217;ve used 1.0.5.0, in package you will found some docs, that might be interesting to read and framework itself in UppercuT folder. 
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s inside? Well, package contains a configuration files, batch/shell scripts, nant scripts and number of tools - <code>MbUnit</code>, <code>MoMa</code>, <code>NAnt</code>, <code>NCover</code>, <code>NUnit</code>. Internally UppercuT uses nant for build automation. If you are not familiar with nant.build scripts, please don&#8217;t worry. UppercuT created in a way, that you very isolated of nant details and perform all configuration only in one place, <code>settings/UppercuT.config</code> - simple XML file.
</p>
<p>
If you want to apply UppercuT to your existing project, I would recommend to do following steps before you start.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Change you folder structure in the way to have on: <code>docs</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>src</code> on higher level of directories tree.</li>
<li>
Solution file (.sln) and all projects are put to <code>src</code> folder.
</li>
<li>
All 3rd parties (nunit, moq, ninject etc.) referenced from lib folder.
</li>
<li>
Project documentation moved to <code>docs</code> folder.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As soon as you done, just copy all content of UppercuT folder into your project folder. You are ready to use it. Before actual use you have to configure it. Fortunately, it have to be done only in one place - <code>settings/UppercutT.config</code> file. You have to provide <code>project.name</code>, <code>path_to_solution</code>, <code>repository.path</code> and <code>source_control_type</code>, <code>test.framework</code> and <code>microsoft.framework</code> (net-4.0 is supported).
</p>
<p>
As you provided all required keys you are able to start build! If you have compliable sources and runnable unit tests, you have to receive SUCCESS build status (I failed to start it at first time, having problems with 
    nunit, please see Issues section below). 
</p>
<p>
Lets see what UppercuT does for us:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It uses source repository to generate <code>_BuildInfo.xml</code> and <code>SolutionVersion.cs</code> files. <code>_BuildInfo.xml</code> contains a digest of build, with revision, version, path to repository, dot-net framework version etc. <code>SolutionVersion.cs</code> is code file that must be referenced from all projects in solution, so they all have a common version. 
</li>
<li>
It compiles all projects in solution.
</li>
<li>
It runs all unit test in solution (please note, it run only units - projects with *Test* in their names. It does smart job to skip Database, Integration tests). 
</li>
<li>
It copies all db scripts and documentation to build_output folder.
</li>
<li>
It generates batches for build deployment and db deployment.
</li>
<li>
It analyzes output binaries with such tools as NCover, NDepend (it is not in package, because it is commercial but if you have it UppercuT will use it), MoMa etc and place results to <code>build_artifacts</code> folder.
</li>
<li>
It packages everything to <code>code_drop</code> folder, where everything is on right places - web content, binaries, db scripts and build artifacts.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A lot of things for free, right? What more you can do?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You can run <code>open.bat</code> that by default open your Visual Studio with solution.
</li>
<li>
You can run <code>test.bat</code> to build and re-run unit tests, <code>test.bat all</code> will run all types of tests - units, integration, database. <code>test.bat</code> useful to be run by some Continues Integration servers as CruiseControl.
</li>
<li>
You can run <code>zip.bat</code>. Very useful feature, that would run build/tests and zip content of <code>code_drop</code> folder into one single zip file (like <code>trackyourtasks.net.v0.1.0.584b2ef4.zip</code>) that could be copied to production system for deployment and placed to repository to track builds. 
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Issues and criticism</h3>
<p>
As I said above first time I run <code>build.bat</code> it failed. The reason was that <code>nunit-console</code> loaded 2.0 runtime, but my test assemblies are build with 4.0 framework. It have been solved by modification of <code>build\analyzers\nunit.test.step</code> and adding one additional argument in <code>exec</code> of <code>run_tests</code> target <code>&#60;arg value="/framework=${microsoft.framework}" /&#62;</code>. Please check my <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/Trackyourtasks.net/commit/f3ef494a00237275017053eb62477d7a1bebc974">commit</a> for details. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ferventcoder">Ferventcoder</a> already contacted me regarding that issue, for I hope in some nearest versions in would be solved :).
</p>
<p>
Another problem I met with coverage reports generation. It just generates them empy. It is not blame for UppercuT but rather for NCover, that seems to have issues with .NET 4.0. In the same time, somehow, Testdriven.net is able to run NCover with properly generated coverage reports. 
</p>
<p>
No more critic yet. What would be nice to have is already defined tasks for <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis">Stylecop</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476(VS.80).aspx">FXCop</a>.
</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
This uppercut turns to be powerfull. If you have no build system yet, UppercuT is recomended.. If you have some &#8220;self-written&#8221; system that you tired to support - UppercuT is recomended.. If you have build system and happy about it, well.. try UppercuT, you could notice something you missing, or otherwise suggest some new feature for UppercuT :).

<p>
Major benefit of TDD is not coverage, 
    regression stability, test problem solving - NO. It is - Test Driven Design 
    (Architecture). Test Driven Design is something that is being born of writing 
    tests before code, writing tests before functionality started to work, 
    writing the tests before you really clear about the rest of system (data 
    flow, integration etc.). Test Driven Design forces you to use old good patterns 
    as Factories, Template Methods.. it forces you to hide implementation behind 
    interface.. it forces you to separate concerns and divide functionality on small objects, each of it responsible for its small function 
    and could be tested exactly for its function. Instead of increase functionality by appending some code to already big function, you encapsulate new functionality to new object, test it in isolation and then easily integrate it to the place where it have to start work on. 
</p>
<p>
The reason why Test Driven Design works is that doing a tests make you a class user, make you focus on its primary goal and interface and just make it impossible (or difficult and annoying) to make a class with multiple responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>
How to get practical benefits of TDD, what level of testing should I consider to be sure I following the plan of TDD? 
</p>
<p>
<small>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> all code samples are created very quickly, just to demonstrate ideas, should not be considered as working examples.
</small>
</p>
<h2>Level 1 - Unit tests</h2>
<p>
Here it all begins. Unit tests are kind of testing of really small parts of objects, like method properties and so on. This is there the actual requirements for the object is 
    created and verified. The major point of unit tests is - they have to be isolated! That means, all object(s), data, view etc. that tested object is 
    depend on, must be hidden behind corresponding interfaces. Please note, that at initial state those interface could not be defined at all (contains no methods) and its actual form will be dictated by actual object needs. 
    Object needs will be clarified on a way of applying next test cases to testable object.  
</p>
<p>
    You have to be always focus on business object or primary object. This is the one that you have to test first. If you are doing registration functionality on site, <code>Registration</code> is class to start. If you are doing calculation application <code>Calculate</code> is class to start. If you are doing web crawling application, <code>Crawler</code> is class to start.
</p>
<p>
It is always like that - business object typically requires 2 things, data and view. In some particular case BO could depend on some external services, that would mean that interface to the service should pass to constructor as well. Also, in some cases it doesn&#8217;t require a view, just returns some data to outside consumer.
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> Some<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> Some(IData data, IView view)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">interface</font> IData<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">//empty</font><br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">interface</font> IView<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">//empty</font><br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
Then tests are being created:
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">[TestFixture]<br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> SomeTests<br>{<br>&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//create method</font><br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> Some CreateSome()<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">return</font> Some(<font color="#0000ff">new</font> DataMock(), <font color="#0000ff">new</font> ViewMock());<br>&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; [Test]<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> SomeInScenarioOne() { }<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; [Test]<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> SomeInScenarioTwo() { }<br><br>&nbsp; [Test]<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> SomeInScenarioThree() { }<br><br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> DataMock : IData<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">//some methods here</font><br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> View :&nbsp;IView<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">//some methods here</font><br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
It is good design that constructor receives the interfaces only, the rest of parameters required supplied by corresponding methods arguments.
</p>
<p>
Once again, business object <strong>asks</strong> interfaces for required data or methods for displaying data. What exact data and methods are required, could be unknown at the beginning, it only depends on current business object needs. So, in a way of implementation goes interfaces of IData and IView started to form its shape. So, at the end they could look like this:
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">interface</font> IData <br>{<br>&nbsp; IQueryable&#60;Columns&#62; GetColumns();<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">void</font> UpdateColumn(<font color="#0000ff">int</font> id, <font color="#0000ff">string</font> name, Column column);<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">void</font> DeleteColumn(Column column);<br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">interface</font> IView<br>{<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">void</font> ShowSuccessMessage(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> message);<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">void</font> ShowFailMessage(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> fail);<br><br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">void</font> DisplayResults(IQueryable&#60;Column&#62; columns);<br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
Note, that we are absolutely don&#8217;t care about actual implementation of both interfaces at the current moment. For instance <code>Data</code> could use SQL database for columns, <code>View</code> could call some Win32 API functions for displaying results. Doesn&#8217;t matter - forget about this at all, just continue with primary object and its functionality and tests.
</p>
<p>
Mock objects should provide required methods in most simple way, like:
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> DataMock : IData <br>{<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> IQueryable&#60;Column&#62; GetColumns();<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> list = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> <font color="#2B91AF">List</font>&#60;Column&#62; { <font color="#0000ff">new</font> Column(1), <font color="#0000ff">new</font> Column(2) };<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> list.AsQuearyable();<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
For the different type of test data you could have a different mocks. Also, it is better to use some existing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">mock frameworks</a>.
</p>
<h2>Level 2 - Data/View tests</h2>
<p>
As interfaces of Data/View granulated after level 1 testing, it is time to implement them. At this time we are really clear of what exactly we are going to implement, since there is already defined contract between client (primary object) and supplier (data/view classes). 
</p>
<p>
Data/View implementation have to be tested also. There are more difficulties in testing them: data depends on SQL Server, that must be up and running, some test data have to be prepared before. View could not be tested in many cases. Netherless, why are implemented in same test before style and finally we have <code>Impl</code> classes implementation. Ones that would be used with primary object after its integration to application.   
</p>
<p>Implementation</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> DataImpl : IData <br>{<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">private</font> DataContext _context;<br><br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> DataImpl(DataContext context)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_context = context;<br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> IQueryable&#60;Column&#62; GetColumns();<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> _context.Exec(<font color="#A31515">"SELECT * FROM COLUMNS"</font>).AsQueryable();<br>&nbsp; }<br> <br>&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//rest of method implementation</font><br>}<br><br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> ViewImpl : IView<br>{<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">void</font> ShowSuccessMessage(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> message)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MessageBox(message);<br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//rest of method implementation</font><br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>

<h2>Level 3 - Integration tests</h2>
<p>
Integration tests are considered to be <a href="http://blog.jbrains.ca/integrated_tests_are_a_scam">evil</a>. I also think so, but I don&#8217;t think that it is possible to completely to avoid them. They are difficult to support and difficult to maintain them, but I think some number of integration tests have to be present to cover some typical scenarios of bugfix test cases.
</p>
<p>
In general, integration would mean - test the primary objects with concrete instances of dependent objects. Integration tests would cover a place where primary object is going to be integrated to. So, if we plan to use <code>Some</code> in <code>SomeAnother</code> you have to test the impact of this class after integration.
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">[TestFixture]<br><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> SomeIntegrationTests<br>{<br>&nbsp; [Test]<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">void</font> IntegrationScenario()<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//arrange</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">var</font> some = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> Some(<font color="#0000ff">new</font> DataImpl(), <font color="#0000ff">new</font> ViewImpl());<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//act</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">var</font> results = some.Act(param1, param2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//post</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//do assert</font><br>&nbsp; }<br><br>&nbsp; [Test]<br>&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">void</font> IntegrationScenarioTwo()<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//arrange (some is integrated to SomeAnother)</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#0000ff">var</font> someAnother = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> SomeAnother(<font color="#0000ff">new</font> DataImpl(), <font color="#0000ff">new</font> ViewImpl());<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//act</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; someAnother.Act();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//post</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#008000">//assert on actual influence of Some class on SomeAnother class</font><br>&nbsp; }<br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<h2>Level 4 - Spec tests</h2>
<p>
The final level is Spec tests. BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is next generation of TDD, focusing on user acceptance criteria&#8217;s as development driver. There are quite good tools for that already like, <a href="http://specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> or <a href="http://storyq.codeplex.com/">StoryQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
Having those type of testing on Level 4, doesn&#8217;t mean that they are created after functionality is ready. It is recommended to create such tests first working with product owner and defining a test stories. 
</p>
<p>
Personally I have no rich experience in BDD, but ideas and success stories with Cucumber (Ruby) makes them worth to look at.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Testing is important. But testing to create tests are pointless. Tests have to be created to create good design, easy to read and maintain code.   
</p>
<p>
By doing tests right, they won&#8217;t complicate your life but make it easier.

<p>Start developing new applications on IIS already is probably good idea, since it is IIS where you application is finally landed to. Working with Cassini is great, cause it fast, requires no maintenance, very easy to start. But it could hide some issues that would surprise you during deployment. </p><p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided to switch my current Asp.net MVC application from Cassini to IIS. It is done very easy, just go to project, Web tab -> Use local IIS Web Server. Select the option and then click on &#8220;Create a virtual directory&#8221;, to create a virtual directory for application.  </p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TLga9AQeq6I/AAAAAAAAG-g/dRc-bMB-Yzc/s1600/projproperties.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 122px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TLga9AQeq6I/AAAAAAAAG-g/dRc-bMB-Yzc/s400/projproperties.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528198177940745122" /></a> <p>But after I started, application just failed.

<p>
It a very dramatic beginning - &#8220;Integrated Tests are a scam&#8221;. a self-replicating virus that takes over your project and burdens you with long-running, fragile, hard-to-understand test suites - a sentence JBrains started his speech!
</p>
<h2>What is integrated tests?</h2>
<p>
Integrated tests checks whole system, not only collaboration between some components. It means any tests where the failure of the test with unjustifiable failures. It is bad, because it is a distraction and give no value.
</p> 
<h2>Integrated tests are slow</h2>
<p>
Integrated tests involves DB, network that makes tests are slow. 
</p>
<h2>Integrated tests are brittle</h2>
<p> 
If you change one small thing you have to fix a lot of tests. JBrains gives a very nice and common example. &#8220;Foreign Keys hell&#8221; - you have a foreign keys in DB, so to insert/remove record to one table, you have to insert/remove record to another table.. and so on. Preparation tests data is very expensive operation, complexity goes as exponential form. Eventually it came up that change that took 1.5 hour start to take 1 days.
</p>
<h2>Goal of unit testing</h2>
<p>
Goal of unit testing is to have quick and correct result. Test failure should point to exact problem in object to be tested. In case of integrated tests, it is possible to have multiple failures, with very few actual understanding of what is wrong.
</p>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>
JBrains introduces term of - <em>Collaboration tests</em> (Interaction tests) - using mock objects or tests doubles. Collaboration is observed as Client-Server architecure. The object that is being tested is Client, the object it depends on is Server. We create interfaces, to make it possible to substitute implementation (using test doubles), we simulate behavior for object we testing. Client object is a completely tested, test double simulate behavior of Server. 
</p>
<p>
This is greatly works, tests pass, but we found a problems. The issue is that object doesn&#8217;t always work as it is expected by tests and having Collaboration tests only is not enough. We need another type of test - <em>Contract tests</em>.
</p>
<p>
Contract tests focuses on Server side, this are ones that actually do SQL to DB, requests by network etc. The goal here is to focus on Contract (or interface) of object and test interface, not exact implementation. Since contract tests are defined, now it is possible to reuse them for any particular implementation. As an example, we could review IList class, that could have different implementations (as array list, linked list etc.), but it have one interface with simple operations like - add, remove, at. We create a number of tests, for all contract operations. Such tests could be put to common class, with abstract operation of object creation (template method pattern), so tests of particular implementation (array list for instance) just inherit common class, override creation function to return array list method and reused all already defined contract tests.  
</p>
<h2>What are benefits?</h2>
<p>
Combining these 2 types of tests give us fast, isolated suites, failure is suite should point to exact issue avoiding creation of complex integration tests. 
</p>
<p>
Later on JBrains gives some mathematical proves of differences between number collaboration/contacts tests and integrated tests, that I just do not want to write here, cause afraid to incorrectly interpret the information. The keynote of the speech is rather simple: forget about complex and heavyweight integration tests, do as much as possible with test doubles running everything in memory, do contract testing for platform depended objects.

<p>
One of few technical speeches on this conference. <a href="http://pragmatists.pl/en/about_us.php">Pawel</a> discusses a vision of production clean code, with a clean tests as key factor of creation good software. That was very interesting and rather quick, so I did only few notes of it.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
&#8220;Most important stuff is to create a clean code - Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Writing a clean code is important! Everybody knows that, but not everybody actually produce clean code. Writing a tests is vital to create reliable, maintable, code. It is a common issue of many developers to forget that tests code quality as such important as production code. 
</p>
<p>
Then we do write tests, we have to be sure that we are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>writing tests that are reliable</li>
<li>writing tests that they are document code</li>
<li>writing tests that they are maintainable</li>
<li>writing tests that they are readable</li>
</ul>
<p>
Writing good code/tests is a hard work! That require time and practice.
</p>
<h2>What test do give?</h2>
<p>
We are spending an effort on tests (a lot of efforts, actually). Why do we do that?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in safe net, awareness of what you did</li>
<li>TDD leads to a Test driven Design!</li>
<li>TDD increasing development speed</li>
<li>TDD produce documentation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>
The more tests you have, more problem you have with them. So, at some point of time it stop to be a documentation. 
</p>
<p>
This is especially matters then you have a lot of integration tests, that could affect each other, provide massive failures without giving clear understanding what is wrong. 
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
What&#8217;s the process of creation the tests, following TDD rules? 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Think First</li>
<li>Trivial First</li> 
<li>Test specifies &#8220;what&#8221;, implementation says &#8220;how&#8221;</li>
<li>You need different levels of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>
Something that helps to produce clean tests. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Coherent naming of tests classes</li>
<li>Coherent naming of tests</li>
<li>Test classes names focus more on functionality</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
If you feel you must comment, something wrong with you code. Tests have to be document itself.
</p>
<p>
Some useful //give, //when, //then (//arrange, //act, //assert).
</p>
<h2>Test setup (Given part of test)</h2>
<p>
DRY (Dont repeat yourself) is major. We usually repeat the setup code for each tests. Have to be extracted to methods, that could be easily reused. Method name should reflect its meaning.
</p>
<h2>Behavior Driven Development</h2>
<p>
It is on top of TDD, we define behaviour. It reflects a user stories that business people create. Focuses, why code should exists. Code have to be a value for customer. Naming is important, language you use reflects the way you think. Naming in code is the same as names by the business people. In BDD we say Examples, Not Tests.
</p>
<p>
By the way, someone suggested good BDD tool for .NET, <a href="http://specflow.org/">http://specflow.org/</a>
</p>
<h2>BDD rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>tests names should be sentences</li>
<li>simple constant template of sentence help to focus in the tests on one thing</li>
</ul>
<h2>A-TDD</h2>
<p>
Acceptance TDD. Scenarios have to written by business people (or at least with them nearby).
</p>
<h2>Tests smells</h2>
<p>Factors that shows something is wrong with test</p>
<ul>
<li>Long setup</li>
<li>Long tests</li>
<li>Many assertions</li>
<li>To many tests methods</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintainable tests</h2>
<p>
Some rules must be followed according to have maintainable tests.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reuse assertion, create &#8220;business&#8221; assertions</li>
<li>Reuse object construction methods</li>
<li>Reuse test setup</li>
<li>Tests should not depend on environment and order of executions</li>
</ul></div>

<p>
The speech by two guys for <a href="http://xpinjection.com/">XPInjection.com</a> who shared they knowledge on such important Agile concept of Done. I was really interested in this speech since this is something that we also trying to use as common practice in our company. 
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Software development involves a lot people: developers, customers, management. And everybody has own &#8220;dreams&#8221; (or goals). Such differentiation of goals could lead to hidden (or opened) conflicts, misunderstanding of business and development, wrong communication and as a result - failure of project. But if we try to look it with another prospective, everybody is actually have one goal - delivery of product. Developers happy to see their work done, managers happy to see it is in budget and met customer criteria&#8217;s and so on. So in general everybody has one common goal. 
</p>
<p>
The way of managing one common understanding is the way of creation of Definition Of Done (DOD).
</p>
<h2>Typical scenarios caused by lack of DOD</h2>
<h3>&#8220;Uncommited stuff&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Developer declare work as done, but sources are not committed to SCM. Developers definition of done - it works on my machine. 
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Useless build&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer said - let&#8217;s deploy on production. Developer said - we still have a lot stuff to work on, merge, tests, DB migration scripts etc. Customer Done is different.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Unstable velocity&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - Well done, our velocity increased to 32 SP, let&#8217;s used for next fixed. Master - I have a lot small bugs to , documentation. Customer - how we change our velocity. Master - let&#8217;s say it is 20. Developers lack understanding of done.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Unverified tasks&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - there is a crash on form, have somebody tried to work before me. Developers - oops, it was quick fix, haven&#8217;t tested it well. I&#8217;ll just do another quick fix for that.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Forgoten requirements&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - my site is very slow, let&#8217;s discuss it on next meeting. Master - who did the performance testing? Aaaa.. no body. Non functional requirements are forgotten.
</p>
<h2>What is definition of Done?</h2>
<p>
Definition of Done: is a contract (number of rules) between different parties of how to treat particular actives state of completeness.
</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>
If you decided to start with with DOD, you need some initial guidelines of implementation, what should you do to &#8220;define&#8221; DOD?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Take it from previous project (but it have to be done carefully, project are different)</li>
<li>Brainstorming, having code quality in mind (start from technical stuff)</li>
<li>Brainstorming, having business problems and wishes</li>
</ul>
<p>
The process of creation of DOD is brainstorming, you have to understand your need, you problems, your goals to create DOD.
</p>
<h2>Who should define</h2>
<p>
Team + Customer have to decide on definition of done.
</p>
<p>What usually happens, as for me, that DOD is created by Team only, because customer (or PO) is not really exited to do that, so this activity is usually skipped, but only understands the importance and consequences in case of major project issues. That&#8217;s why it is Scum Master job to involve customers (PO&#8217;s) as much as possible.</p>
<h2>When to define</h2>
<p>
Ideally at the start of the project. But in case of something wrong, you have to stop and re-implement definition of done, to prevent the problem. Retrospective is good time for changing DOD.
</p>
<h2>Where to store</h2>
<p>
Definition of done is document. Electronic versions is stored in SCM, on wiki site. Printed version have to be &#8216;before eyes&#8217; of Team/SM/PO. It is a good idea to put a copy near board, so everyone sees it on stand-up meeting etc.
</p>
<h2>Different levels of granularity</h2>
<p>
DOD could not cover all aspects of project. So it have to be granulated. DOF for Release, DOD Iteration, DOF for feature, DOF for task and so on.
</p>
<h2>How to control DOF</h2>
<h3>Automation</h3>
<p>
Automate everything you can - of possible try to automate rules from DOF (like using a hook in SVN to control comment). Add static analyzer to build (code quality).
</p>
<h3>Fixed workflow</h3>
<p>
Define a workflow in issue tracking system. As code review: workflow have to be changed to make a &#8216;Code review&#8217; as mandatory state.
</p>
<h3>Responsible persons</h3>
<p>
Execution of DOD is not possible without responsible persons. Scrum Master (person responsible for process), Team Leader, QA. It should be one person!
</p>
<h2>Typical problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>No common understanding - definition of Done have to be reviewed from time to time, to make everyone clear</li>
<li>No commitment - I understand it is imprortant.. but I ignore it. Everybody have to agree. Good idea is to show DOF for job candidates on interview</li>
<li>Unrealistic criteria - for instance 100% of code coverage</li>
<li>Too ideal DOD - you try thing about everything, it is hard to apply. From time to time, clean up DOD</li>
<li>Partially done tasks are accepted - typically on transion. this is a problem, don&#8217;t lie yourself</li>
<li>&#8220;Broken windows&#8221; principle - if someone start to ignore rule, eveybody start to ignore it</li>
<li>&#8220;Development only&#8221; DOF - care only about development side of process, forget rest (doc, QA, deployment)</li>

<p>
Speech by Timofey Yevgrashyn, the pioneer of Ukrainian Agile movement, shares his vision of the history of Agile in Ukraine.
</p>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<ul>
<li>2001: Agile Manifesto signed, dotcom crash, outsourcing growth.. and many Ukrainian outsourcing companies appears</li>
<li>2005: First Scrum/XP projects in Ukraine, first certified Scrum Master</li>
<li>2007: First scrum meeting in Ukraine</li>
<li>2010: a lot of Agile conferences (Agileee, It jam, Agile base camp etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ukranian Agile</h2>
<p>
Timofey did a survey for gathering of information about actual Agile state in Ukraine, which he shared on his speach. Here a some facts of it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>300 Ukrainian CSM (Certified Scrum Master) from ~104000 of the world</li>
<li>Ukraine teams are the &#8220;industry average&#8221;</li>
<li>Weakest areas on Ukrainian teams: retrospectives, planning</li>
</ul>
<p>
Timofey emphasis that we have to move somewhere, but there is no new methodology. Agile is already &#8220;sold&#8221;.. but not implemented. So, a lot of shops are ready to adapt Agile practices and try to do that, but not right (eventually it ends up with blaming Agile that it does not work). Ukrainian Agile adopters have to avoid &#8220;cherry picking&#8221;, implement all required practices (by book, using Shu-approach).  
</p>
<p>
Allan Kelly were present on session did a several comments, that Ukrainian Agile people behave and do same mistake as in UK, as its in whole world. Later on he did very nice tweet: &#8220;#agileee Its reverse-Tolstoy again: All UnAgile teams are UnAgile in the same ways, all Agile teams are Agile in their own unique way&#8221;.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> text below is compilation of notes I made on Agileee 2010 conference, listening to different speakers. I do it to keep knowledge I got on conference, share it with my colleagues and anyone else who interested. It is only about how I heard, interpret, write down the original speech. It also includes my subjective opinion on some topics. So it could not 100% reflects author opinion and original ideas. 
</small>
</p>
<p>
This speech has been done by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alovak">Pavel Gabriel</a> IT professional from Minks. Maybe it was influenced by Pavels not experienced to much for public speaking in English, but speech turns to be very generic, with a lot of obvious things and not really convincing.
</p>
<h2>The story</h2>
<p>
2 programmers 1 manager. Started without testers, after release user found a lot of bugs. The message from Boss was, that hiring a tester will help to improve problems. But Pavel has other opinion on that. Developers could solve quality problems by overselves.
</p>
<p>
So, Pavel initiated a process of improvements, for making accepted-quality products by developers only.
</p>
<h2>Right tools helps make things right</h2>
<p>
Team were using Ruby as it language and Ruby On Rails as their framework of choice. It is really influenced process, cause framework is done with TDD in mind, Ruby is dynamic language that makes it easy with unit testing, a lof already created solutions like Cucumber etc. But tools are not enough, there have to be something that change developers mind to care about quality, to be responsible for quality. 
</p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Most issues is the because no responsibility in their actions. If there are testers, developers stop to test the application. Whole team is responsible for quality, all and no one. 
</p>
<p>
On Pavel&#8217;s opinion responsibility is gathered by Asking Questions, Code review, Demonstration.
</p>
<h2>Awareness</h2>
<p>
Team have to be aware of what is going on around. TDD/BDD is way of improvement of developer awareness. Retrospectives, to discuss progress and problems.
</p>
<p>
Doing a BDD with Cucumber make a developer really clear of what exactly is expected, what roles are involved. 
</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>
Communication is very important, so it is always a goal to improve communication.
</p>
<h2>Question and Answers</h2>
<p>
QnA session turns to be a nightmare :). 90% were out of context of speech, like &#8220;What tools do you use?&#8221;, &#8220;How you test pages?&#8221;, &#8220;How you do security tests?&#8221; and so on. I&#8217;ve tried to ask a common question, like &#8220;You try to did improvements, you convinced your boss you don&#8217;t need testers, developer could do testing.. what was the results? Number of bugs increased/decreased, customers started to be happy?&#8221;. An answer was, &#8220;Customers still unhappy, but users do not find critical bugs, exact statistics does not exists&#8221;. OK, fair enough. The idea of &#8220;testing by developers&#8221; turned out to be - give developers right tools to make them happy to do testing (TDD/BDD, acceptance), make them like to do that, as soon as they are happy they will produce better results. Also, everything depends on professionalism. So, we went back to old saying by Kent Beck - &#8220;XP is a team of Responsible professionals&#8221;, if people is not professional and responsible nothing will helps.
</p>
<p>
I personally like the idea of - create software by developers only. But as for me, it could work good only for small product shops (there customers are product creators actually). It does not fit big organization and outsourcing companies, mainly to to reasons above: in such organization there is just very low percentage of really professional developers.

<p>
Mary&#8217;s speech was quite long with a lot of details and information and it was quite hard to me to understand everything she said. Moreover I was sitting to far from scene, so hardly could see anything on screen. It is definitely not complete. If anyone has a presentation file it would be great to share it. Anyway, I put here what I caught so far.
</p>
<h2>Strategic Inflection Point</h2>
<p>
Mary introduces the concept of &#8220;Strategic Inflection Point&#8221;, as some point on timeframe for every organization were strategic decisions are made. Such decisions are vital for further organization development and growth. 
</p>
<h2>Strategic Inflection Point for Agile?</h2>
<p>
Agile has been created 10 years ago, it is quite old stuff.. and it is time to change!
</p>
<p>
The milestones of Agile could be described as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>version 1.0: processes and tools, comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, follow plan</li>
<li>version 2.0: individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration</li>
<li>version 3.0: team vision and initiatives, validated learning, customer discovery, initiating change</li>
</ul>
<p>
Mary emphasis that now it is time for Management version 3.0!
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s try to review key points for version 3.0.
</p>
<h2>
Team vision and initiatives
</h2>
<p>
&#8220;There is nothing useless as efficiently that which should not be done at all&#8221; - Petter Ducrker.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Most products failures are caused by lack of customers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Bring the team to customers, to understand that actually customer wants.
</p>
<p>
Mary introduces concept of MVP, Minimum Viable Product. It is something with minimal scope that could run to see actual customer demand - does it do the job? Will customers pay for it? What do we need to learn next? You have to measure and repeat.
Experiment -> Learn -> Adjust!
</p>
<p>
And it is vital to make sure that you are building right think and that make sure, that it is build right! 
</p>
<h2>Customer discovery</h2>
<p>
It is like ethnography - watch persons! what do they do, learn it! Try to understand what is happening. Ideation - do prototypes, do iteration.
