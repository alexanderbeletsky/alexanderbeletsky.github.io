<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> text below is compilation of notes I made on AgileBaseCamp 2011 conference, listening to different speakers. I do it to keep knowledge I got on conference, share it with my colleagues and anyone else who interested. It is only about how I heard, interpret, write down the original speech. It also includes my subjective opinion on some topics. So it could not 100% reflects author opinion and original ideas. 
</small>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/VitalyStakhov">Vitaly</a> is a .NET developer shared really nice ideas of the creation of &#8220;safety net&#8221; with unit tests. He works in software delevelopment shop with no testers in it. Having that they manage to keep quality on acceptable level by means of test driven development practices and implemenation of safety net of tests around the product code base.
</p>
<p>
Many of TDD practitioner&#8217;s have heard this term before, but not a lot of have full understanding of it. In general &#8220;Safety Net&#8221; does not mean 100% code coverage, it either don&#8217;t nesserely mean to follow &#8220;test first&#8221; principles in creation of code. Safety net is a methaphor of net used by acrobats in circus. Acrobats are doing dangerous tricks close to cicrus ceil (that&#8217;s a bit high).. As more complex trick is more chances to fall down, but as you fall on safety net you would be still alive. So, with safety net you fail, but not die.
</p>
<p>
Another good methor about the actual position of safety net. If it put to low (close to the floor), resiliency of net might not be enought to compensate your kinetic energy during fall.. if it is put to high (close to ceil), it start to loose it sense and only interfere of making tricks.
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s one more time see, why we using TDD and work so hard to create tests:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>test driven design</strong> - indeed by having testable code you really much affect <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/10/test-driven-design-and-levels-of.html">code design</a>. Design is key factor through the all life-cycle of project</li>
<li><strong>safety net creation</strong> - in other hand we do testing to follow &#8220;cover my ass&#8221; principle, having a good test coverage makes us feel really confortable and confident with application</li>
</ul>
<p>
In real life those to factors could contradict itself. When we originally create the code with TDD we are typically put too much details in test cases. We do verify for methods calls, expected exceptions, argument values etc. It works perfectly at the beginning. But as soon as we start to do refactoring it might turn to situation then a lot of cases became red, just because of implementation details changed! It leads to situation then the changes are applied, application still in workable state.. but tests are failed (safety net is put to high). That makes tests to be fragile.. fragile tests are bad, because it make to feel like &#8220;tests are not useful&#8221;.. so such tests are typically deleted, commented out, skipped. All of these is just a putting safety net low, close to floor. As for me this is even more dangerous then putting it too high.
</p>
<p>
What to do? The the of mitigation this is all the time controlling safety net position. It is very useful to distinguish 2 types of tests:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Interaction - tests that we basically create on &#8220;design&#8221; stage of application (detailed tests)</li>
<li>Component - tests that we basically create to change safety net position (behavior tests)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The point is the interaction tests are &#8220;classical&#8221; unit tests that we create for particular method/class. It works great of design stage of development, time there we have no model at all, we don&#8217;t know how internal structure would like etc. But as it said, the problem is that interaction tests are to much detailed. And as soon as small implementation detail is changed, those tests became red (I found a little analogy with blog post I did recently about <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/04/functional-tests-must-not-be-done-first.html">Functional tests</a>).
</p>
<p>
To mitigate that we look on same problem with different view - components. With components tests we move focus from details to behavior. For instance if in case of moving money from one account to another, we are not particularly interested in what methods called, but we interested that amount is really moved. Type of test that actually tests that is called component.
</p>
<p>
As soon as component test is defined we are no longer interested in interaction tests. Interactions tests became overhead and only slows done the process of development by continues fixes of failed tests. So, as we already have component tests is just possible to remove interaction tests at all.
</p>
<p>
Back to our safety net analogy - with a lot of Interaction (detailed) cases, we are putting net to high, we should move it lower by getting rid of too detailed cases. To compensate that, it is important to have behavior test that would verify that application state still in workable state. This should be really careful and continues process.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> text below is compilation of notes I made on AgileBaseCamp 2011 conference, listening to different speakers. I do it to keep knowledge I got on conference, share it with my colleagues and anyone else who interested. It is only about how I heard, interpret, write down the original speech. It also includes my subjective opinion on some topics. So it could not 100% reflects author opinion and original ideas. 
</small>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://twitter.com/#dmitriev">Sergey Dmitriev</a> is a first russian-speaking Certified Scrum Trainer. On AgileBaseCamp he presented scientific based approach for prioritizing the backlog. I liked his speech since it was very new for me and could be done on practice.
</p>
<p>
The approach is based on Kano analysis with weighted factor matrix. It might sound a little bit complex, but whole process is rather simple and splitted up on 2 stages.
</p>
<h2>Kano analysis of backlog items</h2>
<p>In very simplified version it is basically 2 questions, with 5 answers. Questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel that feature is PRESENT in product?</li>
<li>How do you feel that feature is ABSENT in product?</li>
</ul>
<p>
And answers are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I like that</li>
<li>I expect that</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t care</li>
<li>I can live with that</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t like that</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each item in backlog are put through that questions. It is important that real customers to participate that survey. Due to statistics laws, as biggest sample you have as more precise results you got. Sergey has created a web application that helps to perform such surveys, <a href="http://www.kanosurvey.com/">KanoSurvey</a>.
</p>
<h2>Classification of results</h2>
<p>
Based on users answers and using some complex math behind KanoSurvey would split up all user stories up to 5 classes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have to be done (mandatory) class</strong> - features that customers sees as very important/expected and have to be done fast</li>
<li><strong>Linear class</strong> - linear features are something that you might accomplish but still do not fully satisfy customers (like battery life of mobile phone - if it works 3 days without re-charge.. it is nice, but I would like to have 4 days. Or, if I have 1Gb of storage on new service.. it is nice, but I would like to have 2Gb etc)</li>
<li><strong>Amazing class</strong> - leadership function, something that makes you unique and produce &#8220;wow&#8221;-effect</li>
<li><strong>Inversed class</strong> - features that you you might have, but customers are feeling bad about it</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t care class</strong> - features that customers not interested in</li>
<li><strong>Questionable class</strong> - these are probably mistakes, then users answering &#8220;I want, I don&#8217;t want&#8221; in the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>
The value only persist in first 3 classes of features. So, we use that in further analysis, rest of features are just thrown away are useless.
</p>
<p>
It is done. After analysis it is time for weighing.
</p>
<h2>Weighing</h2>
<p>
With Kano analysis we understood that features are important for our auditorium. Now we need to plan the feature thought releases, to do that we have to prioritize them correctly. Weighing of features helps to do right prioritization.
</p>
<p>
To perform a weighing business criteria&#8217;s have to be defined. It is very up to the product what the business criteria&#8217;s are. It is recommended to select not more than 5, that makes the process simpler. The example of criteria&#8217;s could be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniqueness - weight 3</li>
<li>Sales - weight 2</li>
<li>Low costs - weight 1</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each pre-selected backlog item is assigned with weight.
</p>
<h2>Combining the results</h2>
<p>
Sergey has created an Excel spreadsheet (that is available <a href="http://www.agilecoach.ru/st/materials">here</a>). In the Excel spreadsheet we specify backlog items, estimations in points, class of Kano and it&#8217;s weight. Based on this input spreadsheet would automatically propose desired priority. It is also possible to see value and cost of particular item. This is a priceless information for any Product Owner.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> text below is compilation of notes I made on AgileBaseCamp 2011 conference, listening to different speakers. I do it to keep knowledge I got on conference, share it with my colleagues and anyone else who interested. It is only about how I heard, interpret, write down the original speech. It also includes my subjective opinion on some topics. So it could not 100% reflects author opinion and original ideas. 
</small>
</p>
<p>
That was the opening speech of <a href="http://kiev.agilebasecamp.org/">AgileBaseCamp</a> conference that took place in Kiev, 16-Apr-2011. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alexeykri">Alexey Krivitsky</a> who is head of ScrumGuides was sharing his vision about Agile through last years.  
</p>
<p>
The dates for this Base camp were dedicated to major event in Agile world, namely it is 10 years from <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> has been signed. All of us know who the software development changed with this event, but was it in good way, bad way? Who know&#8217;s and Alexey tries to analyze that.
</p>
<h2>Past</h2>
<p>
Alexey shared his personal story of starting up with Agile. He used to work in big Ukrainian outsourcing company. That time (I think it was somewhere around 2003) this company was adopting CMM3 and customer company was adopting CMM2 itself. Alexey took part on both processes of adoption and did great job there (I know that, because I worked the same company that time and know that efforts were successful :). That was both good experience and key factor to change his mind on software production. He quit the company realizing that his vision very different from one dictated by CMM. 
</p>
<p>
That time Agile was not so well-spread as it is now (I&#8217;m pretty sure that time very few people in Ukraine knew something about Agile, Scrum, Kanban etc). So, having <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/">Alistair Cockburn</a> book printed out on corporate printer he started his journey in Agile world. Not only improving own knowledge and experience, but sharing the information with community.
</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>
One of the software development institutes does statistics of projects success in 1994 and 2004. Figures are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>1994 - success rate 15%</li>
<li>2004 - success rate 34%</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a definitely impact of agile. There was an interesting speech about details of this impact on Agilee 2010 <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/10/agileee-2010-henrik-kniberg-speech.html">Henrik Kniberg speech: The essence of Agile</a>. In a little other words in 10 years we&#8217;ve learned to &#8220;suck less&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
A lot of information about Agile nowadays. Many, many books became available.. a lot of conferences, trainings, blogs. New brands became popular as <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/main">Software Craftsmanship</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">Lean Startup</a>, <a href="http://www.management30.com/">Management 3.0</a> and more. From the management factors agile moving to engineering and business factors. Code is still the key in software (even if a lot of people thinks it is not). 
</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>
Even with a great popularity of Agile it is still not mainstream. We still talk about Agile itself a lot and would continue to talk at least 2 years. Originally it was Waterfall as biggest enemy of Agile, but now this enemy is weak and it is no longer interesting to fight it :). Due to <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/company/about-mike-cohn">Mike Cohn</a> we would stop to talk about Agile at all and simply start to do that. To reach that stage we need to have crowd of people who are &#8220;on-the-same-page&#8221; with understanding of Agile, but it is not the time now. 
</p>
<p>
There is no silver bullet, but there is super glue that unite teams.. Agile is this kind of glue.

<p>
First of all, by functional tests I understand tests of application features primarily from user (UI) perspective, with different set of frameworks - <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Seleminum</a>, <a href="http://watin.org/">Watin</a>, <a href="http://funcunit.com">FuncUnit</a> or whatever. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve seen the cases that functional tests are being implemented either first or immediately after some particular feature is implemented. I think this is a just wrong practice. Even the UI testing could definitely provide value you should think twice before getting to deep with functional testing and apply as development process rule. Functional tests have several serious drawbacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fragility</strong>. Functional tests are extremely fragile. You could run test suite and got green results and re-run them in 5 seconds and got completely red sheet. And there could be thousands of reasons why it happened.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>. They are simply slow. As much tests you have as slow they are. As much slow tests you have as long feedback cycle is. As long feedback cycle is as low value you are getting from tests.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bad isolation</strong>. Because of functional tests have integration nature, it is just not possible to run them in isolated environment. Tests became depended from each other, that in particular leads to fragility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Support</strong>. Implementation of UI test is not trivial thing. Even with so cool frameworks like <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/12/functional-testing-by-javascript-with.html">FuncUnit</a> or <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html">WebDrivers</a> that have strict and clear interface, it could be hard to test some UI feature of application. But support is much more harder - really small change in could turn many tests to red state. In fact, implementation of change that costs you 1 hour, could cost 1 day for correction of tests.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Changes</strong>. We are trying to adopt agile into development world, one of the aspect that makes development really agile is reacting on change. Reacting on change have to be fast. Changes are integral part of development, even if developers hate changes. But as I said above, even small change could ruin UI tests and it is not fast to fix it. It means that cost of change is getting more and more expensive. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, trying to implement UI tests in early development stages or cover all applications features with UI tests is a <strong>waste</strong>. Ratio between effort / value would be just go to zero with time.
</p>
<p>
What I think as recommendation for UI testing: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rely more on unit tests - all server side code must be covered with a <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/10/test-driven-design-and-levels-of.html">different level of testing</a>. Units have to be isolated and fast.
</li>
<li>
Keep view as thin as possible - in ideal you should not have logic in view at all, but modern web application heavily using client side (javascript) logic that affects view. Javascript code have to be unit tested with <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">qUnit</a> or similar frameworks.
</li>
<li>
Don&#8217;t start with UI tests - UI testing have to be done <strong>last</strong>. If the feature is just implemented it does not mean it has to be immediately tested. It has to pass PO approval, QA. Ideally it has to be released to beta group and confirmed that &#8220;this is exactly what we need&#8221;. After feature stabilized test could be added.
</li>
<li>
Don&#8217;t try to test everything - since UI testing cost more, you should be more careful. It has sense to automate smoke test, critical parts of application or parts that have high regression. 
</li>
<li>
Clean up tests regularly - peer tests regularly, if you have bunch of tests for some area that works OK for a long time you might consider to remove those tests, to speedup whole tests process.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Keeping focus only of primary features of application and avoid of testing small stuff should be key for functional tests.

Developers job is nothing more than other engineers specialties except one big difference. Technologies we are using are changing very fast and to feel confidence in daily work you have to be up-to-date with latest changes in development world. That&#8217;s why I usually ask people &#8220;How do you seek for knowledge?&#8221;, &#8220;How you sure you up-to-date?&#8221;. And today I gonna share my primary sources of information.

<p>
I&#8217;ve started actively follow blogs several years ago. Followed any blog I met with useful information (usually by googling for some problem and found the answer). I did know nothing about authors, but after much reading I feel like I know them personally and many of them are actually very famous developers :). Through years I filtered out a lot, so now I look closer to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx</a> - Scott Guthrie is a VP of Microsoft, so all major .NET announcements going from there. Scott does share a lot of examples of &#8220;how-to-use&#8221; some new technology or given very useful links for other resources. Primary source of information for any .NET developer.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/</a> - Scott Hanselman probably one of the most famous .NET guys from Microsoft. He is guru of technology, sharing a lot of interesting stuff in his blog.  
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://haacked.com/">http://haacked.com/</a> - Phil Haack is Program Manager in Microsoft, in particular responsible for ASP.net MVC framework (that I love really much). He is also managing the project that changed .NET world much - <a hfef="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">NuGet</a> and currently he describes a lot from this area in his blog. I also like Phil&#8217;s posts on <a href="http://haacked.com/tags/TDD/default.aspx">TDD</a> and <a href="http://haacked.com/tags/Open%20Source/default.aspx">Open Source</a> projects.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://wekeroad.com/">http://wekeroad.com/</a> - Rob Conery is very famous with his latest start-up project <a href="http://tekpub.com/">Tekpub</a> and a bunch of other open sources projects. He has one of the most interesting blogs I ever follow. I share many ideas Rob has on development and practices.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/</a> - Steve Sanderson, is author of the briliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430228865?tag=stesansblo-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1430228865&adid=0N6ZY1MKSBV6N16NZNM9&">MVC2 book</a> that I highly recommend to read. He is author of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> javascript MVVP framework and his recent posts aimed to it. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/default.aspx">http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/default.aspx</a> - K. Scott Allen blogging for many years from now, so his blog is full of useful info. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://hackingon.net/">http://hackingon.net/</a> - Liam McCleanan is primary .NET developer with a lof of using of Javascript, so he shares knowledge in both areas.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://osherove.com/">http://osherove.com/</a> - Roy Osherove blogs a lot about TDD and Agile software development, he is famous with his book about TDD <a href="http://www.manning.com/osherove/">Art of Unit Testing</a> and his <a href="http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">TDD String Calculator</a> kata.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That&#8217;s a small percentage of all my reading, but I think that is major ones.
</p>
<p>
I use Google Reader to track my RSS subscriptions, seems best choice as for me. I try to check reader at least 2 times per week, but in reality it could be even rare.  
</p>
<h2>Videos / Screencasts</h2>
<p>
With better internet channels video became even more better source of knowledge. Learning from videos is much more productive than reading blogs and books, as for me. There are a lot of free videos that could help you to start up with new technology. Advanced videos are typically paid, but price are affordable and price / value ratio is very low. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.asp.net/">http://www.asp.net/</a> - This actually main source of information of ASP.net developers, tons of videos, blog posts, articles. I reviewed mostly all of ASP.net WebForms then I was learning it.. and some of ASP.net MVC as well. All videos are free that make this recourse priceless :).
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://tekpub.com/">http://tekpub.com/</a> - Tekpub is great for .NET/Ruby developers. There are free and paid videos. I had a chance to watch both and they are superb.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social networks</h2>
<p>
If you think that social networks are only for schoolgirls or people who had nothing to do.. you are right :). But there some social network that really help professional growth.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> - StackOverflow is best of the best of the best QnA site for developers. It allows you to create <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/386751/alexanderb">account</a> ask questions and help other people with answering questions. It has huge popularity because of rating system, as much correct answers you do, as much rating you have.. such simple and good idea that force other people to provide a quality answers :). I like StackOverflow very much and post my questions that I lost hope of getting answer by trying and googling. In 95% I got very precise answers. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com</a> - Best place for hosting open sources projects. Besides hosting the code, it is a true social network. You can use github for <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/07/github-social-coding.html">social coding</a>. Recently I recieved my first pull request, believe me it is good feeling :). As bonus you can get such looking good <a href="http://resume.github.com/?alexanderbeletsky">CV</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a> - I tried to avoid twitter as much as I can, but twitter won :).. Now I really feel power of it. If you follow right people, being polite but not tweeting to much you are on right way. This is probably my main source of information now, RSS slowly moving behind the scene and twitter became main information distribution system. (btw, if you read this line follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alexbeletsky">@alexbeletsky</a> :).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p>
I recently opened podcasts power for myself. I spend at least several hours walking dog or driving car with no value :). Podcasts help you to feel that gap. Stuff that I like the most:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://pragprog.com/podcasts">http://pragprog.com/podcasts</a> - Progmatic Podcasts. <a href="http://pragprog.com">http://pragprog.com</a> is itself very useful recourse.. podcasts are free and extremely interesting. Highly recommended. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a> - .NET Rocks, is greatest .NET technology stack podcast. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://herdingcode.com/">http://herdingcode.com/</a> - Herding Code, very different topics, very great guests. Best for geeks.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">http://thisdeveloperslife.com/</a> - This Developers Life is run by Rob Conery and Scott Hanselman is less technical, more philosophical podcast that&#8217;s nice to listen just to relax and understand what developers from other side of planet think.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Picking a little bit from every source of information make you more comfortable in our fast changing world :).. If you know some great resources that you like, please share as comments.

<p>
We are trying to hire web developer with using of Microsoft technology stack of ASP.net/C#/WebForm/MVC etc. So, I do a lot of interviews nowadays and I found out interesting fact. I&#8217;ve noticed symptoms of disease many of many ASP.net guys suffer from. The people who spent a lot of time with WebForms do not really understand web.
</p>
<p>
Originally WebForms has been designed in perspective to be conveniently used by Visual Basic developers. Ones who created UI in designers and put logic of application into control event handlers methods. That was a good idea because that gave possibility to many people switch to web world, without too much 
    harm their own world of Windows programming (controls, events, handlers). That worked great, because all you have to understand is Page Lifecycle, be aware of controls that Microsoft created for you and be able to drag the control in WYSIWYG editor. The application created in this way was mostly fine, because it was to far to Web 2.0, AJAX, CSS and HTML revolutions.
</p>
<p>
Time has passed. Web stepped far away from a <code>form</code> with <code>submit</code> button and tables for everything, into rich UI applications with complex client side code, styled up with CSS. WebForms issues appeared really seriously, because it too much abstracted you from &#8220;what is actually going on&#8221;. WebForms controls generated HTML for you, did a server side validation. You could tweak a bit of CSS on server side as well. But this is a not controlling of your application, but rather adapting to &#8220;old-school&#8221; type of web development with ASP.net. With such level of abstraction you were loosing many important things.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not saying the WebForms is bad. I&#8217;m saying that WebForms did a bad joke for the people who do not try to see bit far from their nose. If you open your eyes you would see how much web development is far from ASP.net WebForms development. Modern web development is actually started on client side. You have to understand HTML/JS really fine to be efficient in it. You might not be a designer, but you have to be able to style up your HTML from UI mock in PSD. You should understand REST and AJAX to make go from web page to web application. And the issue is - the most ASP.net developers do not know these things. They think that knowing a C# or VB.net is much OK for creation of web application and the rest is work for front-end developers. 
</p>
<p>
Guys, seriously.. If you think: &#8220;HTML is easy, I could do learn in 5 mins&#8221;, &#8220;CSS is nothing to do..&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do javascript&#8221; - you have those symptoms. Please try to markup the page that might look like <a href="http://onehub.com/">that</a>, enchase it with CSS3 transitions and shadows. Try to use jQuery for handling UI. You will see it is not easy at all. And basically your knowledge on C# does not make help you. I would say, it might be even harder than you application server side. Knowing how to do things with WebForms is great, but you should not be only limited to WebForms.
</p>
<p>
So, if your CV says you are <i>web developer</i>, please make sure that your are really able to do <i>web products</i>. Do not limit your self to &#8220;client-side&#8221; or &#8220;server-side&#8221; developer, it does not work any more. Be universal, look for the same things in a different angles, that helps sometimes.

What would you think is best day in developers life? First day of work, last one? Salary or bonuses payment day? All of those are pretty nice, indeed. But I think best day in developers life is day of Release. It is exactly the time than the code you created recently is being pushed out to production and customers are able to see what changes you&#8217;ve done so far. Release makes a really good feeling of &#8220;work is done&#8221;. In reality, of cause, work is not stopped but only begins after release date - production issues, customer reports, change requests.. all of these still need to be handled.
</p>
<p>
Releasing a product is big job. And it is not all about coding. First of all it is well coordinated effort of all groups - Development, QA, Documentation, Product Owners, Stakeholders etc. I&#8217;ve seen situations than products that could be potentially released just stuck on a line, because of lack of coordination. Here the team atmosphere plays important role. If team sees the goal, agreed on method and tools and communicated well it is a big step to success.  
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Report Designer product that is part of <a href="http://e-conomic.com">E-conomic</a> has been released. It took about an year to make this happen. Huge amount of work were done, many lessons learned. We&#8217;ve passed long way from Specification till Integration code to main branch. I personally that it was just too long. With current experience I see a lot of value in frequent releases, so I tend to just-in-time production practices as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>. I world of web products, feedback is extremely fast and cost of defect is not so high, comparing to desktop. 
</p>
<p>
It is good time to exhale, inhale fresh air and self-motivate for next interesting projects. We are now looking forward to make a better codebase, better processes and better products as result. Let&#8217;s start new adventure!

I was recently been adding NUnit to one of mine project&#8217;s and noticed one interesting framework in <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">Nuget</a> channel. It is <a href="http://sharptestex.codeplex.com/">SharpTestsEx</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fabiomaulo">Fabio Maulo</a> and its primary goal is to make your assertions shorter, cleaner and easy to read.
</p>
To start with, it is just enough to install it through Nuget (or manually) and add using statement in your test class file.
<p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
using SharpTestsEx;
</pre>
<p>
SharpTestsEx would add number of <code>Should()</code> extension methods. Suppose you have such case:
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
[Test]
public void Compile_Div_EmptyDivElement()
{
    // arrange
    var compiler = new Compiler();

    // act
    var result = compiler.Compile("div");

    // assert
    Assert.That(result, Is.Equal("&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"), "expected and actual results are different");
}
</pre>
<p>
With SharpTestsEx I&#8217;m changing assert part of test to,
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
[Test]
public void Compile_Div_EmptyDivElement()
{
    // arrange
    var compiler = new Compiler();

    // act
    var result = compiler.Compile("div");

    // assert
    result.Should().Be.EqualTo("&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
}
</pre>
<p>
Note, it is much shorter and mostly plain English sentence: <i>result should be equal to something</i>.. The assertion message for this test is really clean and sufficient, so you mostly won&#8217;t needed and custom messages.
</p>
<p>
If I go further and implement extension method for this <code>Compile</code> method:
</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
static class CompilerTestExtension
{
    public static string Compile(this string expression)
    {
        var c = new Compiler();
        return с.Compile(expression);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
My tests case would be just one line of code:
<pre class="brush: csharp">
[Test]
public void Compile_Div_EmptyDivElement()
{
    // arrange / act / assert
    "div".Compile().Should().Be.EqualTo("&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
}
</pre>
<p>
This is very short and clean notation of test case, even not technical person could read this. You can do more complicated assertions, combining them by <code>And</code> / <code>Not</code> conditions. There are also bunch of useful extensions for strings, sequences.
</p>

<p>
It is exactly one year since I joined <a href="http://e-conomic.com">E-conomic</a> company. Last year I decided to switch the jobs and now I realize how much right decision it was. I got invitation on interview to <a href="http://e-conomic.com">E-conomic</a> where I did a small test application and presented it to management and technical guys (hi Jakob, Chistian). I had no great experience with ASP.net that time, since last years of my career I spent mostly on management tasks. Really, I just reviewed the code that I created year ago and I see it was not so good :). Fortunately, those guys believed that I could bring a value and offer me a job. Since then I try to do my best to proof - you were not wrong.
</p>
<p>
I see work in company as kind of mariage. Indeed, to feel happy in marriage you should have really strong match and level of trust to each other. Probably it is <a href="http://e-conomic.com">E-conomic</a> where I first time understood how important trust between development and management. I forgot what the &#8220;estimation negotiation&#8221;, I forgot the problems with unrealistic project plans created by management and business guys. A lot of problems that only created conflicts on my previous jobs here done in very smooth way.
</p>
<p>
We are developer-centric company. Developers have power here, developers take a decisions, developers do the job. But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben">with great power comes great responsibility</a>. Developers are totally responsible for product quality. Here I saw a new model, not &#8220;Software Developer&#8221; but rather &#8220;Product Developer&#8221;.. Product developers job is not ended on coding and integration changes, but it is more for verification, configuration management and release. We don&#8217;t have testers here, but we have QA. And developers are part of QA also.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy the environment here very much. Even we are highly distributed team I feel the shoulder of each team mate. We working closer, doesn&#8217;t matter we are sitting &gt;1000 km from each other. That was not so fast to get used to work like that, but now I have no problems at all. I really think that I&#8217;m part of the rest of team who mainly located in Copenhagen. This environment constantly inspires: I was happy to restore my blog (that I created in 2008, but then froze it), I do a lot of reading to understand modern web development, I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/11/ive-release-my-own-product-trackytnet.html">released</a> my small product.. and have bunch of new ideas and feel only lack of time to work on all of them :).
</p>
<p>
I would also say that <a href="http://www.ciklum.net/">Ciklum</a> as Ukrainian representative does job very well. Basically 2 major things that I see Ciklum is great: it handles all infrastructure and finance very professional and does not interfere to work directly with client. If I have some kind of problem I know Ciklum would solve it, this is also good level of trust and I appreciate that.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I&#8217;m just happy developer now. And I really much correlate this with <a href="http://e-conomic.com">E-conomic</a>. Last year decision changed my life. I think I found the place where I like to work, even if I spend more than 7 years for that.

<p><small> I&#8217;ve received great feedback on this article. Thanks all of you guys, who provided valuable comments and pull requests on github. I edited the article several time, hope its up-to-date now. You can go directly to <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller">code repository</a> and get the test application, to see what it is all about. In case if you having some issues, just let me know. </small> </p><p style="color: red"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Elmah.MVC is now <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/08/elmah-mvc-controller-released-on-nuget.html">released</a> as NuGet package. No need to read that long blog post, just install it.  <p>Many of you know what the ELMAH is. If you still don&#8217;t, go and read <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/">here</a>. If you care about monitoring and stability of your web application, you definitely consider to integrate ELMAH. There are number of guidelines of how to do that. But all of them do not answer several question that MVC developers really concerned about: </p><ul><li> How to add ELMAH as usual MVC controller? </li>
<li> How to add ELMAH handler to make it secure (accessible only by authorized users) in MVC application? </li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;ll shed the light on both questions here. </p><h2>Quick start up </h2><p>The best way to add ELMAH is to use <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">Nuget</a> package manager (really recommend to install it). I&#8217;m using Nuget UI, so just right click on MVC application, select <i>&#8220;Add Library Package Reference</i> and pickup ELMAH from nuget feed. Nuget will add reference and update <code>web.config</code> with all required configuration. Basically you can start you application with <code>http://localhost/yourapp/elmah.asx</code> and see main ELMAH page. </p><h2>Changing the configuration </h2><p>ELMAH have been developed in ancient history times of Web Forms. And it is nicely done to be as much universal as possible and implemented as HttpHandler. In <code>web.config</code> you have several line of configuration that register this handler. This is of cause works, but URI like this <code>http://localhost/yourapp/elmah.asx</code> is absolutely not MVC way. So, what you have to do is simply comment out those configuration. </p><pre class="brush: xml">&lt;system.web&gt;

        &lt;!--&lt;httpHandlers&gt;
            &lt;add verb=&quot;POST,GET,HEAD&quot; path=&quot;elmah.axd&quot; type=&quot;Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah&quot; /&gt;

</pre><h2>Add ELMAH controller </h2><p>Now add ELMAH controller to application, the code of controller is: </p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class ElmahController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index(string type)
    {
        return new ElmahResult(type);
    }
}
</pre><p>And setup a proper routing for it: </p><pre class="brush: csharp">context.MapRoute(
    "Admin_elmah",
    "Admin/elmah/{type}",
    new { action = "Index", controller = "Elmah", type = UrlParameter.Optional }
);
</pre><h2>Implementation of ElmahResult action result </h2><p>He we go for most interesting part. I&#8217;ve checked the sources of ELMAH and reused <code>Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory</code> to handle those custom HTTP request. After several modifications and pull request by <a href="https://github.com/seba-i">seba-i</a> the code is: </p><pre class="brush: csharp">class ElmahResult : ActionResult
{
    private string _resouceType;

    public ElmahResult(string resouceType)
    {
        _resouceType = resouceType;
    }

    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
    {
        var factory = new Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory();

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_resouceType)) {
            var pathInfo = "." + _resouceType;
            HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(PathForStylesheet(), pathInfo, HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString.ToString());
        }

        var httpHandler = factory.GetHandler(HttpContext.Current, null, null, null);
        httpHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext.Current);
    }

    private string PathForStylesheet() 
    {
        return _resouceType != "stylesheet" ? HttpContext.Current.Request.Path.Replace(String.Format("/{0}", _resouceType), string.Empty) : HttpContext.Current.Request.Path;
    }
}
</pre><h2>Try it now </h2><p>Just build the application and put <code>http://localhost/yourapp/admin/elmah</code> and you will get nice looking ELMAH main page. </p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4zN-4tT3uVQ/TXJ0td3aMhI/AAAAAAAAHUs/i9qSfE3rG3w/s1600/screen.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4zN-4tT3uVQ/TXJ0td3aMhI/AAAAAAAAHUs/i9qSfE3rG3w/s400/screen.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5580651212725432850" /></a> <h2>Making it secure </h2><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.authorizeattribute.aspx">AuthorizeAttribute</a> works great for this purpose. Just put this attribute to <code>ElmahController</code> and now it is only Admin, who has access to it.  </p><pre class="brush: csharp">[Authorize(Users = "Admin")]
public class ElmahController : Controller
{
    // ...
</pre><p>In my applications I use a custom attribute, but the idea still the same.  </p><h2>Allow to view results remotely </h2><p>You definitely want to see results remotely, with no need to access hosting machine. By default, ELMAH do not allow this, but it is easily changed in configuration: </p><pre class="brush: xml">&lt;elmah&gt;
  &lt;security allowRemoteAccess=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;
</pre><h2>Code example </h2><p>Full code example is located in my github repository <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/trackyt.net/blob/master/src/Web/Areas/Admin/Controllers/ElmahController.cs">here</a>. </p><br />
<h2>UPD:</h2><p>I&#8217;ve moved out controller to separate github repostitory. You are free and very welcome to use/fork/pull changes :). Fork & fix it here - <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller">https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller</a>. </p><h2>UPD2:</h2><p>Instead of placing just controller I create test MVC3 application that clearly show how to use Elmah in MVC. Plese check code and README  <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller">here</a>. </p><h2>UPD3:</h2><p>Code placed in this blog post has been changed drastically by latest feedback I recieved for this controller. Please better refer code on github or latest blog post here <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/08/latest-version-of-elmah-mvc-controller.html">Latest version of ELMAH MVC controller</a> </p></div>
