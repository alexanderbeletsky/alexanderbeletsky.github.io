Recently I&#8217;ve started my tiny project. For this project I required access to GitHub by it&#8217;s open API. Implementation were done in javascript, so I started to look for existing javascript frameworks that works with API. On GitHub API help page there is a link for such kind of framework, implemented by <a href="http://github.com/fitzgen">fitzgen</a>. I&#8217;ve opened repository and checked out a small javascript file called <a href="http://github.com/fitzgen/github-api/blob/master/github.js">github.js</a>. It was implemented very nice, accessing API via JSONP (something that I would avoid to implemented by myself, since I&#8217;m not very experienced in that). That was a good news!
</p>
<p>
But bad news was that current implementation lacks something that I require. Namely, Object API that is suppose to provide access to repository objects was missing. So, I&#8217;ve considered it as my change to do first fork!
</p>
<p>
Forking is very native to development with Git - as you would like to contribute to some project, you do fork, this will actually create a copy repository (or branch) you work with.. and if you commit something to your fork, you can give a notification to author. Author is the one who decides, is your changes worth to be included to master branch or not. Fairly simple. I&#8217;ve decided to implement Object part of API by my own, fortunately all infrastructure code was already done, so what I had to do is to learn specification and implement appropriate calls.
</p>
<p>
After I forked github-api repository Nick started to watch it.. so it was also like motivation factor to me. I did my first part of implementation and was ready to commit. Since my not great experience with javascript I was not really sure about my code and had a little worries about a feedback I could receive from author. But, no changes to step back! I&#8217;ve done commit and pull request to author. I was expecting for feedback and received it very soon! Despite of my worries Nick were quite happy on such contribution, moreover he did a very great review and provided my with results. So, after a some corrections we did a successful merge to master branch. I really liked that! Moreover, he helped me to clarify my opened questions regarding javascript and JSONP.     
</p>
<p>
That was really nice experience of collaboration within GitHub. I liked how it happens and I enjoyed that open source style of work.

It might be well known fact, but I just discovered it to myself. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> has a nice feature together with Chrome. If you looking for some information, just start typing stackoverflow.com in Chrome URL bar, as soon as Chrome will suggest you to use http://stackoveflow.com press tab and you will see a prompt to put your query. Just create your query and press enter and you will get results directly from StackOverflow site. It seems a very nice and useful feature, since I frequently use StackOverflow as source of information.

<p>As one of my favorite topics - tools that improve tests quality I would like to describe a <a href="http://site.typemock.com/test-lint">TestLint</a>. It is a rather new tool from famous TypeMock company, so as soon it has been announced I&#8217;ve immediately downloaded it.</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve used it couple of weeks and want to share what I liked:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>It is lightweight, easy to install</li>
<li>It easily detects a empty test cases. In such case it shows a warning near the case</li>
<li>Documentation says that it is <a href="http://site.typemock.com/creating-a-test-lint-rule/">extendable</a> by custom rules, but I haven&#8217;t tried it yes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What my initial feedback on it could be:
<ul>
<li>I would believe my tests are perfect, but &#8220;Empty&#8221; case if only one warning I saw from TestLint so far</li>
<li>Analysis is done on pre-build sources, so to get results you have to build you tests first</li>
<li>You can get analysis only by browsing a sources. It would be nice, if you can get all warnings in separate window</li>
<li>It would be nice to see all rules currently used in some UI</li>
<li>It would be nice if rules could be created not only by API but also through some interface</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, TestLint is free, it doesn&#8217;t crash your Visual Studio, it helps you to do better job in some way - there are no reasons not to install it! I would recommend it and waiting for next versions with improvements.

Programming has changed a lot thought last years, for sure. Solving a problem is no longer now, like sitting with a bunch of books or opened MSDN help and Visual Studio, trying a different approaches. It has began with specialized forums where developers shared the problems they met and expecting other developers to help them out. It worked. Maybe because of developers like to help someone by means of computer stuff, even if they could not talk to the person sitting next table. After, developers started to create personal blogs where written a problems and solutions they met every day. Google search helped a lot to get information from blogs.. and to make this information be helpful. So now, a term &#8220;solving a problem&#8221; turns to &#8220;googling a problem&#8221; and it is very likely that someone with blog, or someone in forum or group has already solved something similar. I hardly could image development now without google.. really.      
</p>
<p>
Web 2.0 bring a new type of communication and collaboration people in internet - social networks. Social networks might be a kind of evolution from forums and groups, but participants of social network has more personality in it (with a rich profile, photos and bio, ratings and so on) and a community around yourself (friends, colleagues, groups etc). If you friend of someone, you are tracking someone&#8217;s activities.. as current status, shared links, new audio or video clips and so on. Social network is so popular now, so I can bet that there no person who uses internet more than several month, who do not have an account in any social network. 
</p>
<p>
Have you ever hear a term &#8220;social coding&#8221;? If you try to google it you definitely be pointed to <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a>. GitHub is a social network, for developers. What developers need from social network? They need the same profiles as in common social network, with information, link to blogs etc, but developer is someone who supposed to produce a code and GitHub makes it possible to submit your code, so other people could see it and comment. GitHub is based on Git source control system. It has a lot of differences with more widely used Subversion and I would say Git is more complex and mature than Subversion. You have to spent some effort to switch your mind from Subversion to Git, but it not really hard to do.
</p>
<p>
Within your account you are creating a Repositories. You can have as many open repositories as you like, and you can submit any code you want. Repositories are main artifacts of network. In a Repository it is not only the source files you can store, but also it provides you with issue tracking system, binary storage for builds, wiki pages. That mean that GitHub could be also treated like a open source project management/development site like a <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/uk-UA/">Code</a> from Google or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a> from Microsoft or old good <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like any other networks it gives you ability to follow and be followed by other participants. Following means you are start to track all persons actions in GitHub, like creation of new repositories, commits, forks, code commentaries. You can also watch some particular Repository of someone, so you will track all changes that happens in repository. If you find something interesting and want to participate you can do a fork of repository (analog of branch in svn) commit to you fork and do a pull request to author, so he can review what you did and merge changed to master branch. Of all that is done nicely in GitHub, with a intuitive dashboard and tools. 
</p>
<p>
GitHub is implemented in Ruby on Rails in very popular in Ruby community. It currently hosts <a href="http://github.com/rails">Rails</a>, and lot of other Ruby project. Also, you will find <a href="http://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6">Linux-2.6 kernel</a> sources of <a href="http://github.com/git/git">git</a> itself.. and <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://github.com/repositories">many many more</a>.
</p> 
<p>
GitHub really bring something new into open source development world.
</p>
<p>
How I use GitHub? Ok, first of all - my blog articles are there. I have a special repository to store html, so I commit drafts and as soon as I&#8217;m ready I put html to my blogspot. All code examples and projects I show in my blog is also in GitHub, so if you would like to check the code you are just following the link I give in post and do that. I&#8217;m educating myself in ASP.net/C#/MVC/JavaScript and so on, so now I also put my tests project there.. so they are accessible in any machine with Git. I follow several persons to see what they are doing. My network is tiny yet.. but let&#8217;s see how it goes! 
</p>
<p>
If you liked idea&#8217;s of GitHub, please create your account and let&#8217;s join.
</p>
<p>
See you on network!

During implementation of Linq to SQL of Entities application you can see such exception:
</p>
<p>
<i>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException : MSDTC on server &#8216;SRV\5118CF33-D353-46&#8217; is unavailable.</i>
</p>
<p>
Generally it means that there are several transactions is being created in application and they have to be managed by a special service, called &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221; that is by default is not started. So, the quickest solution is just to start the service manually. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services and start &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221;. If it is required by your configuration you can set it as &#8220;Automatic&#8221; startup type, to run at as your server up.

<p>
But please be sure <b>what you are doing</b>, because this exception could also show some issues in application. As soon as it is appeared after some code changes, you have to clearly understand that involvement of Distributed Coordinator is expected behaviour. 
</p>
<p>
What happened to me with my Linq to SQL application is following: there are two 
    classes that create instance of DataModel class, first one is DbSetup that responsible for some preparation of data for tests, second is Repository object. DbSetup was also opening a TransactionScope object, to rollback all data that is being created during tests. This what created a problem - as soon as TransactionScope opened in scope of DataModel within DbSetup class, DataModel created in Repository was treated by runtime as a part of another transaction. That&#8217;s why runtime starting to request &#8220;Distributed Transactions Coordinator&#8221; to manage transactions. So, in unit test code I changed the constructor of Repository to accept DataModel created in DbSetup as constructor argument, so only one &#8220;transacted&#8221; DataModel object used in application. That solved my problem, without starting up coordinator.

WebMatrix is something that .NET platform lacks for years. Now it brings the gaps between complexity of ASP.net application and current needs for rapid web development. It could be analog of <a href="http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">Instant Rails</a> for Ruby on Rails developers. So, Web Matrix is a tiny package including simple IDE, IIS Express, SQL compact edition and number of templates. It believe it will be used by bloggers and small size web site holders.

<p>
Recently I&#8217;ve been shared with a very interesting article by <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/author/jeremy-jarrell-/">Jeremy Jarrel</a> about a <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/mutation-testing/">mutating testing</a>. I was really exited about that cause I really like different techniques and approaches that could help to gather better level of code quality (and tests quality). I would like to share my experience of first try it on project I&#8217;m working on now.
</p>
<h2>What Mutating testing is all about?</h2>
<p>
The idea is fairly simple. As soon as you have a code that is being tested by a series of unit tests and all of these unit tests are currently in green state, you are able to validate how good your unit tests are, by changing a tested code a bit a see the results. This &#8220;changing&#8221; procedure is actually called - mutation. In ideal case all green tests have to be turned red, if some of tests are still green that means that testing code is not good enough to react on mutation, so actual test code must be reviewed and corrected. This is something that is called - mutation testing analysis.
</p>
<h2>The project to try on</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;m currently working on project that has been developed for some time, but with no tests. So a lot of legacy code has to be supported. We started to do tests where and thought about 4 months created nearly 300 tests. It is good time to try mutation on those cases. I&#8217;ve assured once more that all tests are good and no failures at this moment. Let&#8217;s go!
</p>
<h2>MutantPower application</h2>
<p>
In the article that I referenced above Jeremy not only gave a theoretical aspects but also provided with a simple mutation tool, called MutantPower. This is also what I&#8217;m going to use throught. So, I&#8217;ve downloaded sources and reviewed them. Code is a really simple, uses Mono <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Cecil</a> framework to load assembly, get all instructions and change instruction <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.brtrue_s.aspx">Brtrue_S</a> to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.brfalse_s.aspx">Brfalse_S</a>, and otherwise. So, I&#8217;ve built application and was ready to start experimenting.
</p>
<h2>First failure</h2>
<p>
I have a one big assembly with a tested code, so what I need to do is to mutate this assembly and re-run all tests to see results. But on a first run of MutantPower I got a <i>NullReferenceException</i>. I&#8217;ve checked out in debugger and the problem was that MutualPower use the Body of MethodDefinition object, but not always methodDefinition contains a Body, so check for null is missing. After some corrections it started to work and I could successfully instrument the assembly.
</p>
<h2>Re-signing of tested assembly</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;ve successfully mutate my assembly and tried to re-run unit tests. It failed at the very beginning, since it was a strong named, run time detects failure of digital signature and refuses to load library. It has to be resigned each time after mutating. It could be easily done by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5b5tt23(VS.80).aspx">sn.exe</a> tool.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">sn.exe -R tested_assembly.dll C:\Work\rd\Testing\TestApplication\bin\Debug\Company.snk</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
</p>
<h2>First unit tests results</h2>
<p>
After resigning assembly successfully loaded and unit tests started. Some tests were passing and a lot of tests were failing (that is have to be during mutation testing). I was quite happy to see first results. But with mutation you have to be really careful and understand real reason of failures. I found out that most of tests failed with <i>NullReferenceException</i> somewhere from deep parts tested assembly. After a bit of investigation I found out that one of the vital application classes could be instantiated. Sure, MutualPower does not distinguish between &#8220;code need to be tested&#8221; and &#8220;infrastructure code&#8221; that makes application able to run at all. So these first results had no sense at all, since the testing not even started.</p>
<h2>Configuration for MutualPower</h2>
<p>
I came up with one simple idea. Extend MutualPower with a configuration file that would say what exact types must be included for mutating to leave infrastructure code as is but affect the rest of code (BLL, DAL, pages etc.). So, I&#8217;ve changed the application to take such configuration into account. After inspection of all test cases created so far I came up with such configuration file:
</p>

</p>
<p>
Now MutualPower will change only types mentioned in configuration file as &#8220;included&#8221;.
</p>
<h2>Next run and Timeout exception</h2>
<p>
After re-mutating and re-signing assembly again I got first more or less meaningful results. Yes, a lot of failures and even more.. my tested hanged out in a middle! This is something that is never have to be happen as soon as you do <a href="http://artofunittesting.com/">good unit tests</a>.
</p>
<p><blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">System.InvalidOperationException : Timeout expired.&nbsp;The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.&nbsp;This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote></p>
<p>
Skipping the details, I found that there is a huge bug in my testing framework that doesn&#8217;t dispose connection to database in case of exception in constructor, so then you have a lot of failures the connection pool is quickly overused and you got TimeOut. Bingo. That might be first valuable result from mutating. Of cause, it is not a but in some production code, but keeping testing code in good shape is also very important. So I fixed the problem and ready to go for next iteration.
</p>
<h2>Analysis of passed</h2>
<p>
Finally, I&#8217;ve got some results for analysis. Only 27 tests are passing, so all of them should be reviewed for actual reason.</p>
<p>
<p>
I&#39;ll do high-level breakdown of &quot;why tests passed&quot;..</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tests from a 3rd parties</b> - we are using <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/19/unit-tests-web-code-without-a-web-server-using-httpsimulator.aspx">HttpSimulator</a> and with a sources, test cases was also included to project. Since we are not modifying and it just works as expected, no need to keep it in test assembly. Should be removed.
</li>
<li>
<b>Tests on code that has not been mutated</b> - tests are passing because you forget to include tested class into MutantPowerConfiguration. Should correct configuration and run again.
</li>
<li>
<b>Empty test cases</b> - test that have no asserts in it. These are not the tests, so it might be either refactored to do asserts either removed at all.
</li>
<li>
<b>Smoke test</b> - the type of test I just to prefer start development with, it just creates a tested object and expects that no failures happened.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s it! Nothing that could show a dumb mistakes either in code or tests that I really wanted to archive. So, I&#8217;ve cleaned up tests a bit and came up with only 8 passing ones.
</p>
<h2>Analysis of failed</h2>
<p>
So, why tests are failing? 99.9% of all failures came from DAL level with a <i>ArgumentOutOfRangeException</i> exception. Meaning that MutantPower changed the assembly so badly that no data could be even retrieved. If no data retrieved -> logic does not start to work -> tests are failed. That turns out to something not mutation, but breaking. MutualPower in its initial version is to simple and for sure required more fine tuning except configuration file. Another aspect related to our architectural/design problem. Currently code of business logic is high cohesion of data access layer, namely all testing is goes on SQL database with no mocks. So, since the lowest layer is corrupted all upper layers just could not stay alive. OK, this conclusion might be a second valuable result gave by mutation.
</p>
<p>
In ideal case all tests my be clearly separated on BLL tests, DAL tests. It has no much sense to mutate DAL code, as for me. BLL tests must use mocks, so be completely independent on database, database testing should be part of integration testing. By doing this it might happen that mutation give a valuable feedback.
</p>
<p>
So, just initial analysis of failures showed architectural drawbacks of application that must be some how corrected to get more benefits of mutating testing.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Mutation testing is definitely something interesting but requires an effort to get benefits from it.
</li>
<li>
It would give more meaningful results if application is created with a good separation of layers and usage a mocks in unit tests.
</li>
<li>
It helped out to see behavior of tests in more stressed conditions and find a recourse leakage in tests.
</li>
<li>
Some areas for improvements exists to update MutantPower with fine tuning.
</li>
<li>
It is not seems to be daily based practice, but more likely once for iteration of two. Also thinking about criteria related to tests number like, as soon as next 100 tests added, run mutation testing to check quality.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Finally I&#8217;ve put sources and binaries on github.

 I&#8217;ve noticed that I do a lot of spell mistakes in my posts, so I started to 
    think about some online tools that would do spell checking before submit post to blog. There are several good enough, but the problem is that they work with a plain text, but I do posts in HTML first.. so checker was giving a lot of mistakes on HTML tags, that is pretty annoying.
</p>
<p>
As I do my posts in VS initially I started to look for some pluggins that would do spell checking just within Visual Studio, so you don&#8217;t need any other tools. I came up with very nice one, so I want to share it with you:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7c8341f1-ebac-40c8-92c2-476db8d523ce">Checker for VS 2010 by Noah Richards</a>
</p>
<p>
Easy to install and use.. Spell checking for HTML/ASP.net code, as well as source code (commentaries). So, I hope are not going to see spell any bugs in my posts any more.
