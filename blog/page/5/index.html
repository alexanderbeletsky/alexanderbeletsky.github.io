    <p>        Even JavaScript language and front-end development has been much matured recent time, I still see a lot of confusion about usage of different frameworks and libraries.<br />
    </p>    <p>        For a half of year I use Backbone.js and feel much satisfied with it. It&#8217;s very popular library, probably because of personal popularity of the creator of Backbone.js <a href="http://en.twitter.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, very much known also as author of CoffeScript language.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Frameworks and libraries</h2>    <p>        There are differences between frameworks and libraries. In one sentence, &#8220;library is then you call some code, framework is then your code is called from somewhere&#8221;. The Backbone.js is clearly library. You usually have a lot of different options with libraries and less with frameworks. It&#8217;s very minimalistic, actually.<br />
    </p>    <p>        At core it only contains of only 4 components (Model, Collection, View, Router). This minimalism is both power and weak side of Backbone.js. The power is that you can build things whatever you like, Backbone fits the experience really smoothly. In the same time, you are really confused the time you just started, since you simply don&#8217;t understand how to make everything work together properly.<br />
    </p>    <h2>The essence of Backbone.js</h2>    <p>        In one of the podcasts with Jeremy, he said &#8220;Backbone is something that almost every developer will come to theirselves.. dealing with JavaScript applications for a while&#8221;. I could not agree more. If you have previous experience in programming and you see the value of architecture and design, you will definitely start to invent something similar to Backbone.<br />
    </p>    <p>        After some time spend of development jQuery based application you will realize many fundamental issues, like: data does not belong to DOM, events are not limited on jQuery and so on. But the main issue is jQuery apps usually violates the &#8220;Single Responsibility Principle&#8221;, mixing and manipulation with data and views in the same time. Experienced developers, tries to eliminate SRP issues as soon as possible, almost naturally coming to MVC pattern.<br />
    </p>    <p>        In essence the Backbone is a way to structure you application better. It makes clear de-coupling between data and views that render that data. It&#8217;s nothing more than that.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Abstracting things out</h2>    <p>        Programming is a matter of abstractions. As better abstractions you have as better code you have. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Every application works with data. The data does not appear in browser just like that, it have to fetched from somewhere. It&#8217;s also have to be persisted somewhere. The data could be changed and you have to validate that change is right. If some part of data is changing, you want to be notified on that change. Notice that, this is a very common functionality you want to keep between all data classes - initialization, validation, persistence. This is where the <code>Backbone.Model</code> comes out. With <code>Backbone.Model</code> all that things are already &#8220;in the box&#8221; you just need to apply your own strategies of implementation.<br />
    </p>    <p>        You typically don&#8217;t deal with one instance of model. REST interfaces are usually expose something like <code>/api/tasks</code> or <code>/api/photos</code> and so on. You need to group the models into collections. Collection (similar to model) are able fetch and persist itself, all it needs to know is the actual type of Model and URL. This is where <code>Backbone.Collection</code> shies. You are keeping all models close together, if some model become destroyed the collection will be updated, so it always in consistent state.<br />
    </p>    <p>        With view is basically render your models as DOM structure. So, the <code>Backbone.View</code> is abstraction with primarily method - <code>render</code>. Backbone does not say, how exactly you are going to do that. You can create handcrafted HTML and append it DOM, or use some templating mechanisms. Instead, it provides you convenient methods for listening to view events (like clicks, focusout or any other DOM supported events). Inside the handlers you either could update related model or apply some changes to view parts, whatever.<br />
    </p>    <p>        And finally <code>Backbone.Router</code> is a facility to building, so called Single Page Applications (SPA). SPA&#8217;s most popular example is GMail. You browsing emails, writing and sending - without and page reloads. What&#8217;s changing is only hash part of URL (like #inbox, #sent, #all). Router is handling hash change events and triggers registered handler. Inside the handler, you can initialize the corresponding application.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Don&#8217;t repeat yourself</h2>    <p>        Now, please let me know. How many times did you create (read copy-n-paste) the code for RESTful data persistence? How many times, you did you create code for validation? How many hours you spend for looking for some event listener provoking the bug in your app and hiding somewhere among 200 .js files?<br />
    </p>    <p>        If your answer, more that 2 - stop doing that. Don&#8217;t repeat yourself - reuse. And better - reuse from best.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        There are great solutions, created by people experienced than me, amplified by huge community behind. <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone">Backbone.js</a> is one best representatives of such solutions. Having a something that I could rely on, that works good and there <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backbone.js">places</a> to get help is very strong reason for me, to keep doing that, instead of re-invent wheel yet another time.<br />

<p>        It&#8217;s been a almost a month how I started to re-implement my continues delivery application - <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate">Candidate</a>. In my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/08/re-thinking-candidate-application.html">previous</a> post I already mentioned some areas are going to improved, what technologies considered to be used. I haven&#8217;t managed to make huge progress on project so far, but I got something to show.<br />
    </p>    <h2>        Overall application architecture<br />
    </h2>    <p>        I try to build it with classical API oriented architecture in mind. It means that server side code exposes some simple HTTP API, the rest of stuff happening on browser. Fortunately, I got really simple UI, but still UI plays really important role. So far, I spent 80% in Sublime for front-end and 20% of time in Visual Studio for back-end.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Server side technology stack is NancyFX + RavenDB, client side build with Backbone.js + Require.js.<br />
    </p>    <p>        The primary application change is that it&#8217;s no longer IIS application, but just standalone app.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tVV2Kf9ujEY/UEef4mai0fI/AAAAAAAAJBY/jhlWIM6dh8w/s678/image-1.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tVV2Kf9ujEY/UEef4mai0fI/AAAAAAAAJBY/jhlWIM6dh8w/s678/image-1.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>    So, you just launch an .exe file, after application warm up, candidate is available at <a href="#">http://localhost:12543</a>.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-p9lFdi3LimI/UEef4vVEQDI/AAAAAAAAJBU/IzxoLO3EK1E/s800/image-2.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-p9lFdi3LimI/UEef4vVEQDI/AAAAAAAAJBU/IzxoLO3EK1E/s800/image-2.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        To simplify a life a bit (and do not harm they eyes of users) I&#8217;m using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> CSS framework and happy with it.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Server side</h2>    <p>        <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy">NancyFX</a> is very lightweight framework, but it requires some skills. So far, I met <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/NancyFX">several</a> interesting challenges, that has been successfully solved. But, Nancy does it job and does it pretty well.<br />
    </p>    <p>        <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> initial impressions are really positive. I&#8217;m currently doing very basic functionality (as inserting, querying and deletion of documents). But, indeed working with document oriented database feels much simple and native for C# developer. Forget about any SQL, schemas, ORM&#8217;s - store and restore POCO&#8217;s, that all you need to know. RavenDB API is very clear and intuitive. <br />
    </p>    <p>        I used embedded version of RavenDB, which suites me best - since I want to minimize an effort for application installation.<br />
    </p>    <p>        As I said above, server side exposes HTTP API which receives and responds with JSON based payload. There would be some interfaces for starting/stopping the deployment tasks.. but the rest is happening in client.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Client side</h2>    <p>        Since I met <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> framework I thought to myself: &#8220;I will never ever writing &#8216;scripts&#8217; in front-end, instead I&#8217;ll be doing browser powered applications&#8221;. Backbone.js introduces structure in front-end. Front-end development with Backbone.js is no longer <code>$.ajax</code> calls and updates of DOM inside the <code>success:</code> handlers. With Backbones&#8217;s main entities you build front-end apps in similar way as it would be desktop applications.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Being much inspired with Addy Osmani <a href="http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/">Writing Modular Javascript</a> blog post and speeches, I trying to apply some of these practices. In particular I&#8217;m using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> for AMD and Backbone&#8217;s views as kind of widgets (or modules).<br />
    </p>    <p>        The front end is being build in SPA (Single Page Application) style, which is kind of new to me. Backbone.Router is great component though and I don&#8217;t need anything more, at least for now. I wish to keep UI as much responsive and fast.<br />
    </p>    <p>        As always, you are welcome to review <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/master/src/Candidate.Nancy.Selfhosted/App">server side</a> or <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/master/src/Candidate.Nancy.Selfhosted/Client">client side</a> code, let me know your opinion or ask questions.<br />

<p>        It&#8217;s been my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/08/it-jam-2011-in-odessa_23.html">second time</a> I attended IT Jam, the biggest IT gathering in Ukraine. This time, the rules has been completely changed. Instead of traditional speeches, the organizers decided to make <a href="http://www.it-jam.ciklum.net/community_spot">community spots</a>, there people might have a chance to group and discuss different issues. There were number of spots there: .NET, JavaScript, iOS, UX etc.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PXtIUYdVpXk/UERVoHU_CJI/AAAAAAAAJBA/xq8Nq_PIPJ4/s720/551981_10151051085473549_2145381509_n.jpg"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PXtIUYdVpXk/UERVoHU_CJI/AAAAAAAAJBA/xq8Nq_PIPJ4/s720/551981_10151051085473549_2145381509_n.jpg" style="width:620px" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        Besides the community spots, there was several stages where <a href="http://www.it-jam.ciklum.net/visionary_speakers">visionary speakers</a> did their presentations. I had a chance to listen Christopher Marsh, and really enjoyed his vision of lean product development. At 13.00 community spots started to operate, to I went there.<br />
    </p>    <p>        .NET spot is a closest to me, since it&#8217;s lead by guys whom I personally know and number of participants are well known guys from local .NET community. <a href="http://twitter.com/chaliy">Mike Chaliy</a> asked me to give a brief talk on.. Node.js. So, together with <a href="http://twitter.com/dmytromindra">Dmytro Mindra</a> we did kind of introduction to Node.js to .NET developers, introducing to the history of this rather new technology, it&#8217;s main features and showing some real code. Planned for 15 minutes, we&#8217;ve spend about hour talking about it. Besides of pure technology talk, I shared some experience of <a href="http://debitoor.de">e-conomic</a> switch from .NET to Node.js stack for the latest products and how it worked for us (mainly my message was, throw away your boring C# and switch to JS.. so I had a chance to been kicked off the spot, but everything were fine at the very end). .NET spot was very active, attracted many many participants. People were talking about newest .NET framework features, like Async, Azure, Kinect etc.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m8E-81DXCZI/UERVoMXNaII/AAAAAAAAJA8/NZSQvx7otfo/s512/375872_10151051090393549_448366005_n.jpg"><br />
        <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m8E-81DXCZI/UERVoMXNaII/AAAAAAAAJA8/NZSQvx7otfo/s512/375872_10151051090393549_448366005_n.jpg" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        JavaScript spot leaded by my team mate <a href="http://ua.linkedin.com/in/edjafarov">Eldar Djafarov</a> was also very exiting. Guys did a very nice job, preparing some cool JavaScript applications, that people might play with. I joined it, having a quite interesting discussion of front end development issues with different JavaScript MVC frameworks. Again, the experience we&#8217;ve got in company regarding Backbone.js, unit testing and tools was very interesting to developers.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Almost 4 hours on community spots were like one minute to me.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I really liked how the things went. From my perspective the idea of community spots was really cool. Probably, it&#8217;s to difficult for introverts, to feel them self comfortable with this environment, so mix up of formal speeches and spots could be a good idea for future conferences.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I wish to say thanks for organizers of this event for everybody involved, great effort guys. As always, it was so great to meet with colleagues from other cities and shake the hand for guys, whom I knew only virtually before. See you next year!<br />

<p>    If you haven&#8217;t seen Bret Victor&#8217;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">talk</a>, please find 54 minutes and do it. This video is giving many interesting ideas, inspiring people to create new things. The main idea of his talk (at least as I understood it), is whatever you do, you have to see the result of your work as soon as possible. This short feedback cycle is important, cause it leads to better ideas and good productivity.<br />
</p><p>    As a developers, we do code. Applying Victor&#8217;s principle, ideally we should have this code immediately running and showing it&#8217;s results of execution. Some experimental IDE&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/">Light Table</a> is trying to adopt this principle now. <br />
</p><p>    If you develop web applications, you spend much time working with HTML/CSS/JS, which being executed by browser. The typical workflow, is to open your text editor, correct some mark-up or javascript code, then switch to browser, press F5 and see the results. It doesn&#8217;t sound like a big job, but believe me, it&#8217;s getting annoying and boring in very short time.<br />
</p><h2>LiveReload comes to help</h2><p>    Ideal workflow is something like, you apply changes to JS, press Ctrl + S in your text editor and browser get&#8217;s immediately reloaded, showing the results of execution. That&#8217;s sounds really cool and fortunately there is great solution for that. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/mockko/livereload">LiveReload</a> from <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit">Andrey Tarantsov</a>.<br />
</p><p>    It can be installed as either a <code>&lt;script type=&quot;javascript&quot; scr=&quot;/libs/livereload.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag in your app, or as a browser plug-in. I prefer the plug-in way, since it could work with any app and requires no code modifications. There plugins for <a href="https://www.google.com.ua/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CFYQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fjnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei&ei=Ld8xUOzuD8bhtQaThIGYAw&usg=AFQjCNGfX_zDQVCEb-jaq2-TSiR7TqxQWw&sig2=039AdwBtqrpgzbt-irnUcQ">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com.ua/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&sqi=2&ved=0CEMQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-us%2Ffirefox%2Faddon%2Flivereload%2F&ei=f98xUMPVM4rTtAbVioHgAg&usg=AFQjCNGsE_l-orw8MwyGW9mcQ2-y8H2F5Q&sig2=lYx9rMgyuI2384_1y2MZ8w">FireFox</a> and <a href="http://download.livereload.com/2.0.8/LiveReload-2.0.8.safariextz">Safari</a>.<br />
</p><p>    How does it work? Take a look on a diagram.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F9itf6E8NAA/UDIAFm3zrsI/AAAAAAAAJAE/3LEaKfedmls/s776/image-1.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F9itf6E8NAA/UDIAFm3zrsI/AAAAAAAAJAE/3LEaKfedmls/s776/image-1.png" style="width: 620px"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>    The LiveReload plug-in (or livereload.js script) expect&#8217;s that there is Web Socket Server, where it connects to and start to listen for changes. Web Socket Server is responsible for tracking changes and if changes occurred, it send the package of data with information about the changes, back to the web socket. LiveReload receives the data and reloads the browser.<br />
</p><p>    As you installed plug-in and pressed &#8220;LR&#8221; button, it&#8217;s gonna light green if connection to server is successful, otherwise it will pop-up the message, that server is not available.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-R7b4Vtvid0g/UDIAFn5cdxI/AAAAAAAAJAA/MUpTAS2pizU/s535/image-3.png"><br />

</a><br />
<p>    So, to make LiveReload work properly we have to provide an Web Socket Server, that conforms to LiveReload interface. <br />
</p><h2>LiveReload + Sublime Text 2</h2><p>    There is a great plug-in for Sublime Text 2, from <a href="https://github.com/dz0ny">Janez Troha</a> called, <a href="https://github.com/dz0ny/LiveReload-sublimetext2">LiveReload-sublimetext2</a>. It&#8217;s get easily installed through standard ST2 package installer (package name is &#8220;LiveReload&#8221;). Basically, it instantiate Web Socket Server inside the sublime, listening to editors event&#8217;s and push data to socket.<br />
</p><p>    As soon as it&#8217;s installed, and browser connected to it, you can now modify any HTML/JS/CSS file. As file get changed and saved, you will see LiveReload-sublimetext2 will immediately send the command and browser got refreshed.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N21_9n_1At0/UDIAGA6k7II/AAAAAAAAJAM/7pWtPo9sKm4/s620/image-4.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N21_9n_1At0/UDIAGA6k7II/AAAAAAAAJAM/7pWtPo9sKm4/s620/image-4.png" style="width: 620px"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>    When I first time tried that, I could not believe how smooth it was. Can&#8217;t even believe how I lived with-out it before. Nothing to add here, just nice and easy.<br />
</p><h2>LiveReload + any IDE</h2><p>    &#8220;Any IDE&#8221; in my case means Visual Studio, where I spent some time if I&#8217;m not Sublime. Unfortunately, there are no dedicated plugin for VS (as seems there are no for JIdea and Eclipse, so good opportunity for developers). Even so, you have a chance to get benefits of LiveReload. All you need to have is <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> or <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> installed on your machine.<br />
</p><p>    Originally, LiveReload comes with Ruby-based <a href="https://github.com/mockko/livereload/tree/master/server">server</a>, that you can install and used from gems. I&#8217;m not much that comfortable with Ruby, so I went Node.js way.<br />
</p><p>    There is Node-base LiveReload web socket <a href="https://github.com/josh/node-livereload">server</a> from <a href="https://github.com/josh">Joshua Peek</a>. It&#8217;s written in coffee-script and actually really easy to adopt. Here is an <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/master/tools/livereload">example</a>, how I used that for my project. With a simple .cmd, I start up livereload, specifying which folder to observe.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    @echo off
    node ./tools/livereload/server.js ./src/Candidate.Nancy.Selfhosted/Client/
</pre><p>    It will start up the server, wait till browser connects and watch all files in folder for changes.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Clurp7tbGjA/UDIAGXCTBGI/AAAAAAAAJAQ/ghdC6eHVSQc/s620/image-5.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Clurp7tbGjA/UDIAGXCTBGI/AAAAAAAAJAQ/ghdC6eHVSQc/s620/image-5.png" style="width: 620px"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>    Not everything so perfect with that approach, though. There are 2 reasons, why I did not finally like that:<br />
</p><ol>    <li>It is slow. Internally node-livereload uses <code>fs.watchFile</code>, which is quite slow (at least on Windows). That mean&#8217;s if you save the file, it takes 1-1.5 seconds for browser to refresh.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Does not catch up new files. You have to restart server, to make it watch newly created files.<br />
    </li>
</ol><h2>Mixing things up</h2><p>    There reasons above prevent me to go on with <a href="https://github.com/josh/node-livereload">node-livereload</a>. So, even if I work on .NET-based application, I do C# in Visual Studio, but HTML/CSS/JS in Sublime, having the all it&#8217;s benefits. So, I basically have 2 things opened side-by-side.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--1QZU1dRym0/UDIAGZjoJQI/AAAAAAAAJAY/Nkb7uhE66wA/s570/image-6.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--1QZU1dRym0/UDIAGZjoJQI/AAAAAAAAJAY/Nkb7uhE66wA/s570/image-6.png" style="width: 620px"/><br />
</a><br />
<h2>Conclusions</h2><p>    I felt much productivity boost with LiveReload. I have Sublime opened on one monitor and Chrome + WebKit Tools on another. As soon I change something, I see the results immediately, catching up errors in console as early as possible. It works so great then you TDD&#8217;ing your JavaScript code, as you write tests and implementation and it&#8217;s been re-run with each save (like a continues testing with AutoTest, NCrunch etc.).<br />
</p><p>    That works very fine to me, I don&#8217;t want to press F5 anymore. Do you?<br />

    <div class="content">
      <div class='post'>
<p>    As I have chosen <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy">NancyFX</a> framework for my <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/nancy">pet project</a>, I&#8217;ve spend yet another week playing with it. My original expectations were - I&#8217;ll be super-duper-fast with it, since it&#8217;s so comprehensive and powerful. One more time I have to admit - every technology has it&#8217;s learning curve, it could be smooth, but it is still curve. Time need to be invested to learn it.<br />
</p><p>    The good thing, it&#8217;s very interesting to fight new challenges, and it&#8217;s so cool that Nancy just &#8220;does not contain everything&#8221;, but actually allows to customize things, as you wish to.<br />
</p><h2>Nancy&#8217;s default JSON formatter</h2><p>    Nancy is using <a href="https://github.com/grendello">Marek Habersack&#8217;s</a> version <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/blob/master/src/Nancy/Json/JsonSerializer.cs">JsonSerializer</a>, which is a smart wrapper on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.aspx">JavaScriptSerializer</a>. It works, fine.. but the problem, it does not provide any facilities to change default formatting settings. That would mean, if you have a module with method like that,<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class SitesModule : NancyModule
{
    public SitesModule() : base("/api/sites")
    {
        Get["/"] = parameters => Response.AsJson(new[] {new { Name = "Site 1", DeployStatus = "Deployed" }});
    }
}
</pre><p>    You will get valid JSON, but it would serialize all C# properties, as they are:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    "[{"Name":"Site 1","DeployStatus":"Deployed "}]"
</pre><p>    Don&#8217;t know about you, but it makes me sick too work with uppercase object fields in JavaScript. Fortunately, such advanced JavaScript serialization libraries as <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx">JSON.NET</a> has formatting features. So, our goal is to create custom serialize (based on JSON.NET) and integrate it to Nancy&#8217;s pipeline.<br />
</p><h2>    JSON.NET based serialization<br />
</h2><p>    In order to do that, we need to implement special interface (guess it&#8217;s name?) - <code>ISerializer</code>. Without further explanation, I just copy and paste code here:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">public class JsonNetSerializer : ISerializer
{
    private readonly JsonSerializer _serializer;

    public JsonNetSerializer()
    {
        var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings
                        {
                            ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver()
                        };

        _serializer = JsonSerializer.Create(settings);
    }

    public bool CanSerialize(string contentType)
    {
        return contentType == &quot;application/json&quot;;
    }

    public void Serialize&lt;TModel&gt;(string contentType, TModel model, Stream outputStream)
    {
        using (var writer = new JsonTextWriter(new StreamWriter(outputStream)))
        {
            _serializer.Serialize(writer, model);
            writer.Flush();
        }
    }
}
</pre><h2>Changing the configuration</h2><p>    NancyFX bootstrapper has a special method, which have to be overridden in order to change internal configuration. There is a very convenient helper, that is useful for changing some particular bits of config.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">protected override NancyInternalConfiguration InternalConfiguration
{
    get
    {
        return NancyInternalConfiguration.WithOverrides(c => c.Serializers.Insert(0, typeof(JsonNetSerializer)));
    }
}
</pre><p>    Please note, I&#8217;m inserting that to position 0, just to make sure it&#8217;s *before* default <code>JsonSerializer</code> type, since AsJson() response formatter is using <code>FirstOrDefault</code> strategy to find corresponding serialize class. Just build and re-start your app, and from now your JSON&#8217;s would be looking really good:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">    "[{"name":"Site 1","deployStatus":"Deployed "}]"
</pre><p>    Much more better now!<br />

<p>    I&#8217;ve just pushed new version of <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH.MVC NuGet package</a> - 2.0.1. It covers some interesting parts, that I can&#8217;t wait to share.<br />
</p><h2>VB.NET projects support</h2><p>    For quite a while, I&#8217;ve been asked to provide VB.NET support. Originally, ELMAH.MVC was shipped as singe .cs file, that would not possible to use in VB.NET project at all. VB.NET support were planned for 2.0, but unfortunately it did not happen. I&#8217;ve just tested 2.0.1 and it works great with VB.NET, so all VB.NET developers - you are welcome to use it.<br />
</p><h2>Custom ELMAH route</h2><p>    Another demanded feature was to provide custom path to ELMAH controller. By default ELMAH is available under <code>/elmah</code>, which is nice, but sometimes you what to have a freedom to change it. It&#8217;s now possible, <code>web.config</code> has additional configuration section, <code>&lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.route&quot; value=&quot;elmah&quot; /&gt;</code>. By setting up elmah.mvc.route parameter, you can tweek a default one, like <code>&lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.route&quot; value=&quot;secure/admin/errors&quot; /&gt;</code> for instance.<br />
</p><h2>Besides of that&#8230;</h2><p>    ELMAH.MVC does not depend on WebActivator any longer. I&#8217;ve removed <code>App_Start.cs</code> code and used <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2010/05/16/three-hidden-extensibility-gems-in-asp-net-4.aspx">PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute</a> attribute. That allows to make a package more tiny + actually made it possible to avoid separate NuGet package for VB.NET projects.<br />

<p>    <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx">NancyFX</a> applications are full of conventions. The default conventions are good enough, especially if you use ASP.NET hosting, where you probably don&#8217;t even care. If you plan to do self-hosting application, you typically want to change some bits.<br />
</p><p>    In my case, during <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/nancy">Candidate</a> application re-writing, I wanted to have some custom folder layout, that would be clean and not confuse application users with so many details. In fact, I wanted something that in deployed state looks like this:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wQqqT_kUXpY/UCqEGGRQBRI/AAAAAAAAI_w/erBVjE9lhiw/s620/image-1.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wQqqT_kUXpY/UCqEGGRQBRI/AAAAAAAAI_w/erBVjE9lhiw/s620/image-1.png" alt="folder layout" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>    &#8216;Bin&#8217; folder would contain the application itself, as well as all referenced assemblies. &#8216;Client&#8217; folder would contain all client side code - HTML/CSS/Javascript. Initially I thought to make all of those as embedded resources, but firstly <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11888813/nancyfx-using-embedded-views">did not worked</a> on Nancy v.0.11.0, secondly having those files placed separately make it possible to easy application updates (patching).<br />
</p><p>    Fortunately, it is easy to apply any folder layout you want. There are 2 types of recourses that Nancy is looking from outside, they are - views and static content. Both of them are resolved by default conventions and those conventions applied against the application root.<br />
</p><h2>Changing the application root</h2><p>    In my case, executables are places in Bin folder, but resources are placed one level above. By default, the application root is <code>Environment.CurrentDirectory</code> and I need to changed that. In order to make this happen, you have to implement <code>IRootProvider</code> instance.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">namespace Candidate.Nancy.Selfhosted.App
{
    public class PathProvider : IRootPathProvider
    {
        public string GetRootPath()
        {
            return Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, @"..\"));
        }
    }
}
</pre><p>    There is a little pitfall, that I got into. Please, make sure that root folder is <strong>absolute</strong> path (<code>Path.GetFullPath</code> - returns absolute path). If you didn&#8217;t do that, some part of application could not work right. I&#8217;ve sent a <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/pull/706">pull request</a> for <code>StaticContentConventionBuilder</code> class, but more appropriate fix is actually having it rooted. <br />
</p><p>    After, just place the type of path provider instance into Nancy bootstrapper class, as overridable property:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">protected override Type RootPathProvider
{
    get
    {
        return typeof(PathProvider);
    }
}
</pre><h2>Changing the default conventions</h2><p>    Now, we have to teach Nancy to look for view and static resources right.<br />
</p><p>    The bootstapper contains corresponding virtual method, called <code>ConfigureConventions</code>. There I&#8217;ll overrider the default ones, like that:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">protected override void ConfigureConventions(NancyConventions nancyConventions)
{
    // static content
    nancyConventions.StaticContentsConventions.Clear();
    nancyConventions.StaticContentsConventions.Add(StaticContentConventionBuilder.AddDirectory("scripts",
                                                                                                "Client/scripts"));
    nancyConventions.StaticContentsConventions.Add(StaticContentConventionBuilder.AddDirectory("content",
                                                                                                "Client/content"));
    // view location
    nancyConventions.ViewLocationConventions.Clear();
    nancyConventions.ViewLocationConventions.Add((viewName, model, context) => string.Concat("Client/views/", viewName));
    nancyConventions.ViewLocationConventions.Add((viewName, model, context) => string.Concat("Client/views/", context.ModuleName, "/", viewName));
}
</pre><p>    For view location conventions you just need to provider the folder (relative to rootfolder), where the view are located. I used only 2 simple conventions: 1) view is just placed under /views folder 2) view is placed under /view/moduleName folder. <br />
</p><p>    For static resources, it a little bit trickier. You have to return the *response* object, for corresponding request. Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/blob/master/src/Nancy/Conventions/StaticContentConventionBuilder.cs">StaticContentConventionBuilder</a> class, has some helper methods that make it simpler. <br />

<p>   I&#8217;ve released 0.0.1 version of <a href="http://alexanderbeletsky.github.com/candidate/">Candidate</a> pretty long time ago. I was actually quite happy how the things went, before I collected some initial feedback. Even, if I can see the application useful, almost all responders had a different opinion. Let&#8217;s briefly see the major concerns.<br />
</p><h2>IIS hosting</h2><p>    Original idea of Candidate was that it works as usual ASP.NET application, hosted under IIS. That worked really bad, though. Candidate is performing a some operations that requires extended permissions (for git, msbuild, file system operations etc.). That means that IIS web site has to be configured to run under under your personal account (or any other administrative account, with set-up SSH keys, access to msbuild etc). <br />
</p><p>    All of that created a bit of overhead. First of all, Candidate has to be installed and configured on IIS. Even, it is possible to create kind of installer to automate this job, it does not sound good. In other hand, some people might have very strict policies on their machines, so it is not even possible to change any kind of IIS settings under it.<br />
</p><p>    So, it turned out to be bad idea for this particular application.<br />
</p><h2>Deployment scenarios</h2><p>    The primary deployment scenario that implemented in Candidate is local one. It means, it&#8217;s able to build and test the site and deploy it to local IIS. I did so, since I use the same scenario for deployment of <a href="http://trackyt.net/">trackyt.net</a>, which is hosted on VPS and deployed by Jenkins running on the same server.<br />
</p><p>    But many people are not using VPS, but rather sharing hosting there they are not even able to install any kind of other software. So, they are more interested in <i>remote</i> deployment, not <i>local</i> one. With the re-invention of <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">Azure</a>, you might consider scenarios of deployment existing web application to it seamlessly.<br />
</p><p>    Local deployments was a good for prototype, but not good at all for product.<br />
</p><h2>Technical stuff</h2><p>    I stick to framework named <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/bounce">Bounce</a>. It&#8217;s very powerful product, that basically allows to write a deployment scripts in .NET languages. Then I originally saw it, I thought it&#8217;s great since it does everything I need, including git operations, msbuild and IIS sites deployment. Even more, Bounce is the one of the best .NET code I ever seen, so respect to <a href="https://github.com/refractalize">refractalize</a>.<br />
</p><p>    But.. Bounce, is not that good for long perspective. It required to create a lot of <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/master/Candidate.Core/Configurations">configuration code</a>, hard to change logging options and further extension.<br />
</p><p>    For a long running product I need more lightweight and robust approach.<br />
</p><h2>Starting it over again</h2><p>    Considering all things above, I decided to re-start the project, almost from the scratch.<br />
</p><p>    It would be based on 3 different technologies, that in my opinion are agile enough to allow me to build what I want. <br />
</p><ul>    <li><strong>NancyFX</strong> - will be used as application host. Currently Nancy is 0.11 version, that has a lot of improvements comparing to 0.9 that I used. The main reason to choose that, is Nancy allows to create self-hosted application. It&#8217;s basically .exe application, that you can run and it starts the HTTP server. I plan to have all-in-one executable, that do not require any installations and will prepare all required infrastructure and first run. That would solve both installation and IIS limitations problem.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>RavenDB</strong> - as application document storage. In previous version I didn&#8217;t use any kind of database at all, being happy with simple <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/blob/master/Candidate.Core/Settings/SettingsManager.cs">SettingsManager</a> to store .NET objects into JSON files. The reason is that I didn&#8217;t have any dependencies on any software (as SQL Express). With Raven it is possible to use Embedded mode, so it does not require any service running, just the assemblies.<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>PowerShell</strong> - as deployment scripts. No more VCS, build, test and deploy code in C#. I plan to have a generic PowerShell scripts that would be easy to run and maintain. With a PowerShell I hope to extend the deployment scenarios to support Local, FTP, MS Deploy, Azure deployments.</li>
</ul><p>    Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not yet proficient with any of these technologies. It makes me very exited to learn something new. I&#8217;ve already created a <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/candidate/tree/nancy">branch</a> where some basic infrastructure is prepared. My goal would be create first prototype in 2 - 3 weeks.<br />
</p><p>    And I want to appreciate everyone who provided feedback and useful technical suggestions. I hope it would turn in something good.<br />

<p>    While I was working on <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH.MVC v.2.0.0</a> I noticed a something that contradicts the way I understand how the controller resolving mechanism works. Before, I always thought that namespaces matters, but in practice I saw it otherwise.<br />
</p><h2>Controller in separate class assembly</h2><p>    The good way of distribution re-usable software is class assembly. Suppose, I have 2 projects - one ASP.NET MVC web application (<code>MvcApplication2</code>), and another one is class assembly (<code>Awesome.Mvc.Lib</code>). Web application references the class library.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Y6YKPiPmC5U/UA_1XCcp2jI/AAAAAAAAI-0/lybgi7ALYoc/s620/image-1.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Y6YKPiPmC5U/UA_1XCcp2jI/AAAAAAAAI-0/lybgi7ALYoc/s620/image-1.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>    I want to have some particular controller to be exposed from <code>Awesome.Mvc.Lib</code>. Namely, I want to have a controller inside the class library, that would be accessible from <code>MvcApplication2</code>. I&#8217;ll add some <code>ShinnyController.cs</code> inside.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">namespace Awesome.Mvc.Lib
{
    public class ShinnyController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public string Index()
        {
            return "I'm in Shinny controller";
        }
    }
}    
</pre><p>    Originally, my thought was, <code>ShinnyController</code> will always be &#8220;invisible&#8221; for <code>MvcApplication2</code>, since it placed into another namespace. Meaning, if I don&#8217;t initialize a route pointing to <code>ShinnyController</code>, the routing mechanisms would never match it. But, if I run the application and go <code>http://localhost:26810/shinny</code> I will see:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rK7AMYLTMEw/UA_1XPcDdYI/AAAAAAAAI-w/SLICb6ZxIh0/s620/image-2.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rK7AMYLTMEw/UA_1XPcDdYI/AAAAAAAAI-w/SLICb6ZxIh0/s620/image-2.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>    This is totally unexpected to me! It turns out that default route is matching the controller/action from <code>Awesome.Mvc.Lib</code> class library.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">routes.MapRoute(
    "Default", // Route name
    "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
    new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
);
</pre><p>    What I&#8217;m expecting though is that <code>ShinnyController.cs</code> have to be &#8220;explicitly&#8221; routed, and ideally placed into its own sub-URL, like <code>http://localhost:26810/awesome/shinny</code>.<br />
</p><h2>What about namespaces fallback?</h2><p>    I&#8217;ve asked this question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077554/controller-in-separate-assembly-and-routing">stackoverflow</a>. Even if I had good answer, it did not make it happy. So, to get the behavior I want, I need to do the following: <br />
</p><ol>    <li>Change the default routing to explicitly mention the namespace and set fallback to false:</li>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

        var route = routes.MapRoute(
            "Default", // Route name
            "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
            new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }, // Parameter defaults
            new[] { "MvcApplication2" }
        );

        route.DataTokens["UseNamespaceFallback"] = false;

    }
</pre>    <li>Create an Area in <code>Awesome.Mvc.Lib</code> and configure routing to it:</li>
<pre class="brush: csharp">public class AwesomeAreaRegistration : AreaRegistration
{
    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute("Awesome_default", "Awesome/{controller}/{action}", new { action = "Index" });
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return "Awesome"; }
    }
}
</pre></ol><p>After I did so, I can reach the <code>http://localhost:26810/awesome/shinny</code>:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rnnOpRSIxE4/UA_1XFPhrPI/AAAAAAAAI-s/htheaCJ-EIE/s620/image-3.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rnnOpRSIxE4/UA_1XFPhrPI/AAAAAAAAI-s/htheaCJ-EIE/s620/image-3.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>And in the same time, <code>http://localhost:26810/shinny</code> is getting to be rejected:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VP6ZPs8hAS8/UA_1Xye5KYI/AAAAAAAAI-4/rjY9e6_aCfs/s620/image-4.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VP6ZPs8hAS8/UA_1Xye5KYI/AAAAAAAAI-4/rjY9e6_aCfs/s620/image-4.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>Even though, it looks like desired behavior.. It sucks.<br />
</p><h2>Why it sucks?</h2><p>    By placing the controllers into separate assembly, I&#8217;m thinking about it&#8217;s distribution by simple bin-deployment or by Nuget. Both ways assumes, simple copy of assembly into particular location, adding references and that&#8217;s it! I don&#8217;t suppose to change default routing that comes in ASP.NET MVC applications templates.<br />
</p><p>    I want to have the control of routes *inside* the class library, not outside of it (in web application). But, the default behavior of ASP.NET MVC routing is completely different. Moreover, in some cases I want users of library to be able to <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc/issues/14">control</a> the routing. <br />
</p><p>    In my opinion the default behavior with <code>UseNamespaceFallback = true</code> is wrong. I&#8217;ll give one more example, to proof it.<br />
</p><p>    I removed namespace fallback code from default route, after added new Area, called Api. Inside this Area I place one controller, called <code>SimpleController</code>.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: csharp">namespace MvcApplication2.Areas.Api.Controllers
{
    public class SimpleController : Controller
    {
        public string Index()
        {
            return "I'm simple controller from API area";
        }

    }
}
</pre><p>The controller is reachable, as expected:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2NcIgQ4VJHM/UA_1YBawaqI/AAAAAAAAI_I/1qbj9KT-4HA/s620/image-5.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2NcIgQ4VJHM/UA_1YBawaqI/AAAAAAAAI_I/1qbj9KT-4HA/s620/image-5.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>But now, I try to access <code>/simple</code>:<br />
</p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-un47RILi9do/UA_1YYLqlWI/AAAAAAAAI_A/Jv4J5u5uFGg/s630/image-6.png"><br />
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-un47RILi9do/UA_1YYLqlWI/AAAAAAAAI_A/Jv4J5u5uFGg/s630/image-6.png" /><br />
</a><br />
<p>Hey WTF? The whole idea of Areas is just ruined. What I&#8217;m doing wrong?<br />
</p><p>I&#8217;m feeling very frustrated about this issue. Even though I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/12/inside-aspnet-mvc-instantiation-of.html">understand</a> why it happens, it smells like a bug for me? It works exactly the same for ASP.NET MVC 2, 3, 4. I&#8217;m asking you guys, to help to clarify the problem. What is your opinion on that? Are you agree on such default behavior?<br />

<p>    It&#8217;s not farewell letter in style of &#8220;Goodbye .NET&#8221;. But, I just realized that I haven&#8217;t created any .NET code in about three month. That is pretty much. Mostly all the stuff I currently do, both at work and for fun projects, I do in JavaScript.<br />
</p><p>    I love .NET and love C# language. C# is probably one of the best language I ever programmed with. I think that .NET is my comfort zone. Web technologies as ASP.NET MVC, Web API, NancyFX are great. But, as I <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/03/aspnet-developers-disease.html">said</a> long time ago server side development is not enough to create cool web apps.<br />
</p><h2>Front-end development</h2><p>    For modern web application, the front-end part became as equally important as back-end. In <a href="http://www.e-conomic.com/">e-conomic</a> we are doing large scale JavaScript applications. According to <a href="http://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani&#8217;s</a> definition, the large scale JavaScript applications are:<br />
</p><blockquote>non-trivial applications requiring significant developer effort to maintain, where most heavy lifting of data manipulation and display falls to the browser.<br />
</blockquote><p>    This is exactly definition of application we released just few days ago, <a href="https://www.debitoor.de/">debitoor.de</a>. And if you are doing front-end, the JavaScript is your friend. Actually, you don&#8217;t even have a choice.. It&#8217;s either JavaScript or some another language that could be compiled down to JavaScript as <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/">ClojureScript</a> or <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> languages. The importance of JavaScript, it&#8217;s common adoption, growing of community knowledge base made Scott Hanselman call JavaScript <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx">assembly language for web</a>. <br />
</p><p>    We&#8217;ve chosen <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> as front end development framework. With a backbone JavaScript code became to have structure. Having a proper code structure is vital for any project. I&#8217;ve started to learn Backbone and even I still thinking it&#8217;s too minimalistic and non-complete, I believe that was a huge step forward.<br />
</p><p>    Having implemented and stabilized HTTP API for application, almost all new features implementation was at front end. That means, new features for product were actually born in JavaScript code.<br />
</p><h2>Back-end development</h2><p>    As might know from my earlier <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/12/why-new-technologies-move-your-product.html">post</a> we&#8217;ve chosen ASP.NET MVC to build our HTTP API on. That worked well at the beginning, but later decision were taken to move out the API to Node.js platform. So, another team started to work on new API project, basically implementing existing API interfaces from ASP.NET MVC in Node.js.<br />
</p><p>    Being wisely architected, our front-end did not have major ASP.NET MVC dependencies. We did not use any specific features (like Razor) or anything else just in sake of minification of efforts during switching back-end platform. And I would say it worked really well.<br />
</p><p>    Node.js based API built on <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> framework, that suites nice for such kind of work. There is a great blog post about <a href="http://nodeguide.com/convincing_the_boss.html">convincing</a> you boss to use <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Node.js + <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MondoDB</a> is very suitable for JSON API applications, for several reasons. First of all is performance, Node.js is known for it&#8217;s async I/O operations that is so perfect for web. Second is simplicity (relational simplicity, of course). Serving JSON objects inside JavaScript, storing/restoring them as MongoDB documents makes the platform and approaches very solid.<br />
</p><p>    So, the new stuff from HTTP API also got born of JavaScript code. Check out nice post of <a href="https://plus.google.com/107092994415731288478/posts">Allan Ebdrup</a> (one of the Node.js inspiration guys inside e-conomic) about our experience with <a href="http://techtalk.e-conomic.com/developing-with-node-js-and-mongodb-part-i/">Node.js and MongoDB</a>.<br />
</p><h2>How does it feel like?</h2><p>    So, I&#8217;ve started to work almost all the time for front-end having Sublime Text 2 + Chrome Developers Tools as IDE. It was a really unusual at the beginning, after many years in Visual Studio. <br />
</p><p>    I feel myself more productive with JavaScript now. I write the code with JavaScript construction and sometimes thinking myself &#8220;how would I do in C#?&#8221; and it feels like in C# it would be much harder. I like dynamic nature of language.<br />
</p><p>    Besides the coding I have pleasure of new infrastructure. Setting up .NET solution, containing ~80 projects, long build process, setup of MS SQL and re-staring of IIS.. All of that made a lot of idle time, read wasted time. I&#8217;m in idle, during waiting till build is finished.. or waiting 30 sec while IIS update AppDomain if I rebuild and press F5. It easily can take up to 2 hours per working day just wasted. <br />
</p><p>    Node.js + MongoBD environment is extremely easy to setup, amazingly fast to work with. I&#8217;m restaring the application in 1 sec, just by stopping node process and running it again. With a tools like <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon/">nodemon</a>, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just save the code and after a sec, press F5 in browser to test it. All of that are increases general developers happiness.<br />
</p><p>    JavaScript is difficult language and Node.js is new platform that requires respect and time to learn. Node.js is probably one of the best <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">documented</a> projects I ever worked with. Besides, it&#8217;s open source. It means you can learn from sources. I haven&#8217;t dig inside Node.js code itself, but I did look inside the Express.js then I had an issue and I found the answer as I see how particular method works.<br />
</p><p>    Even though, Backbone.js code and Node.js code are completely different stuff, having the same language both front-end and back-end is great thing. In particular it minimizes the language context-switching then you do coding. It&#8217;s possible to apply similar patterns and practices both ends.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>    Being a JavaScript developer works good for me so far. I opened just entire new world and would like to explore it more. I hope JavaScript would be my comfort zone some day.<br />
