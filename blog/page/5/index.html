<p>        Yesterday, I have finally received results for my Final Exams of CS101 Udacity course. I did it! <br />
    </p>    <p>        I have successfully accomplished that course, received the certificate with &#8220;High Distinction&#8221;. To be honest, I thought it would be &#8220;Highest Distinction&#8221;, since I was pretty sure about correctness of all my solutions posted. But reality is different, you can never be sure. Next time, I&#8217;ll probably put more attention to verification of my code. Nevertheless, here is my certificate.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2wAuJhZyw98/T9mOrLPBgJI/AAAAAAAAI1I/yFPb5J7BW3c/s720/cert.png"><br />

    </a><br />
    <p>        I&#8217;m really happy that I managed to make this happen. It&#8217;s probably nothing to proud for, but I feel much motivate for further Udacity courses. As I said in previous post, I enrolled for next ones on statistics and algorithms. Hope I will be able to go through them, with at least same results I got for CS101.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Once again, thanks to <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> for such great opportunities.<br />

<p>        I&#8217;ve just pushed new <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">Elmah.MVC</a> package. It contains several changes that I described on my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/06/elmahmvc-v20-is-coming.html">previous</a> post. Current version is v.2.0.0-rc, release candidate that I&#8217;m about to spent sometime with testing and collecting feedback before it&#8217;s availability.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I think ELMAH.MVC is getting it&#8217;s shape. Hopefully it will be as easy to use as indented.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Changes highlights</h2>    <p>        Quickly recap the major and breaking changes of ELMAH.MVC 2.0.<br />
    </p>    <h3>Deployed as class library</h3>    <p>        First noticeable change is that ELMAH.MVC is no longer deployed as several source files, having new Area and Elmah controller inside. The the sake of compatibility and reach functionality it is now deployed as <code>Elmah.Mvc.dll</code>. It&#8217;s using David&#8217;s Ebbo <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/WebActivator">WebActivator</a> project to bootstrap itself, registering routes and global filters.<br />
    </p>    <h3>New URL to access ELMAH dashboard</h3>    <p>        In 2.0 ELMAH is accessed by <code>/elmah</code> route (not <code>/admin/elmah</code> as it was in previous versions). There are several reasons for that. First one is because of new &#8216;Admin&#8217; area is not created anymore, second is the really strange behavior is ASP.NET MVC default routing rules. <br />
    </p>    <h3>HandleErrorAttribute inside</h3>    <p>        If you tried to use ELMAH in ASP.NET MVC, you are probably implemented your own HandleErrorAttribute, as it&#8217;s shown in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766610/how-to-get-elmah-to-work-with-asp-net-mvc-handleerror-attribute">example</a>. You no longer need to apply this custom code with Elmah.MVC. As soon you installed package, so can safely remove your HandleError attribute, since it&#8217;s already included into package.<br />
    </p>    <h3>No more /elmah.axd</h3>    <p>        In previous Elmah.MVC version, you have to go to <code>web.config</code> file and remove all handlers manually. Elmah.MVC 2.0 is now having <code>elmah.corelibrary</code> as dependency and provides it&#8217;s own web.config.transform that excludes all legacy stuff. In short, no more <code>/elmah.axd</code> to remove.<br />
    </p>    <h3>Configurable authorization rules</h3>    <p>        Now, you are very flexible with authorization rules of <code>ElmahController</code>. web.config contains several <code>elmah.mvc.*</code> app keys you can tweak it. Disable or apply authentication based on roles, no problem. <br />
    </p>    <h3>Logging with customError=&#8221;On&#8221;</h3>    <p>        Something that <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a> noticed and <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller/issues/13">registered</a>. Now, you should not have any problems with logging unhandled exceptions, even if customErrors is enabled.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Trying it out!</h2>    <p>        I would be really happy if you help me to test it. You are welcome to try it out. Please install new package and let me know your opinion or bugs you might find. To install preliminary version, just do.<br />
    </p>    <div class="commandWrapper">        <div class="commandPrompt">            <p class="command">                PM&gt; Install-Package Elmah.MVC -Pre<br />
            </p>        </div>    </div></div>

<p>        <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">Elmah.MVC</a> is rather popular package in NuGet gallery. Being submitted about year ago it currently has about ~14K downloads. I received a lot of nice feedback and to be honest feel quite happy that people are using it. Being extremely simple it requires almost no effort to support. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Anyways, several month ago I received an email from <a href="https://nuget.org/profiles/james%20driscoll">James Driscoll</a> one of the major contributors to ELMAH project. James says that he is working on similar problem, namely easy to pickup ELMAH error handling within ASP.NET MVC applications. He saw my package, but in the same time he has his own prototype in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah-sandbox/">ELMAH.Sandbox</a> project, hosted on google-code. Instead of creating yet another NuGet package he proposed to join our efforts and release next version of ELMAH.MVC. That was the beginning of ELMAH.MVC v2.0. <br />
    </p>    <h2>What will be changed?</h2>    <p>        <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">Elmah.MVC</a> is really simple one, actually delivered as 2 C# code files. It creates new ASP.NET MVC area and register route to ElmahController, which is just an adapter to ELMAH LogFactory. It worked very smooth, but with more functionality this approach no longer work.<br />
    </p>    <h3>Pack ELMAH.MVC into separate class library</h3>    <p>        The idea is to bother user as less as possible. Ideally he just drops the DLL into Bin folder and it start to work. In real world it&#8217;s a bit more complex, but anyway. Elmah.MVC will be packed and delivered as class library.<br />
    </p>    <h3>Support in VB.NET projects</h3>    <p>        Since it will be just a class library, VB.NET developers finally could use Elmah.MVC without any manual code conversion. I don&#8217;t know how many ASP.NET MVC3 applications are developed in VB.NET, but I think it&#8217;s still nice step towards compatibility. <br />
    </p>    <h3>HandleError attribute</h3>    <p>        A lot of people, including myself are using <code>HandleErrorAttribute</code> on controllers to redirect user for nice looking error page if something goes wrong. This mean you handle the error by yourself, so it won&#8217;t appear on ELMAH log. That is very big disadvantage of current Elmah.MVC. This will be fixed as new global filter added, that will care that everything will be properly logged.<br />
    </p>    <h3>Several small fixes</h3>    <p>        So far, I&#8217;ve collected some <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller/issues?sort=created&state=open">issues</a> that just was in line and waited to be fixed. It&#8217;s a good time to get rid of those.<br />
    </p>    <h2>What&#8217;s the plan?</h2>    <p>        Good for me, James did all heavylifting. I will backport some good code into new project. I&#8217;ve created new <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller/tree/v.2.0.0">branch</a> and already started to work. Unfortunately, I could see some breaking changes there. At the end of this week, I&#8217;ll have new package ready to test. You can track the progress on github by watching v.2.0 <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/elmah.mvc.controller/issues/milestones">milestone</a>.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I will need your help guys to test that thing out. If everything goes fine, I&#8217;ll update NuGet package as soon as possible.<br />

<p>As I said in my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/05/cs101-building-search-engine-week-5-and.html">previous</a> post, last several units of CS101 were a little tought. Not so difficult, but it made me a little worry what&#8217;s it gonna be in final exams. Being posted right in time, I had to conclude Unit 7 before I start with exams. That time, I had some doubts if I&#8217;m able to meet course deadline.<br />
</p><p>Fortunatelly, Unit 7 was non-technical one. I went throught it rather quickly. Some scenes for this unit were taken in <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Compute History Museum</a>. This place is just amazing, I wish I had a chance to visit it someday. We&#8217;ve been passed throught a pre-historical computers (like Babbage machine), first hard drives and other interesting stuff. Besides of that we guested Mozilla company talking to it&#8217;s president and developers about open source projects, infuence of open source and some thoughts on how to be involved in open source community.<br />
</p><p>The final exam appeared to be not so difficult. I submitted it in time, even earlier than expected. I was also quite surpised, to see that deadline is a little prolonged up to 4th of June. Anyway, the solutions are submitted and now it would take up to 2 weeks waiting for results. I really looking forward and hoping to get my certificate.<br />
</p><p>Conluding this series of posts I have to say - Udacity courses are awesome! I really appreciate <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/">David Evans</a> and <a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/">Sebastian Thrun</a> for making all that happen. My big credit goes to David who had lead CS101 and was just a perfect professor, clearly describe all the material and showing nice examples. I would like to say &#8216;Thank you&#8217; for everyone envolved.<br />
</p><p>I think CS101 was great &#8216;warm-up&#8217; course. I would not stop on that, but I already enrolled for next ones. This time I&#8217;ve choosen more fundametal -  <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/st101/CourseRev/1">ST101 - Introduction to Statistics</a> and <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs215/CourseRev/1">CS215 - Algorithms, Crunching Social Networks</a>. Both courses are starting June 25. Not sure, would it be possible to make them on parallel, so I might hold one if it would be to difficult. Besides of that I&#8217;m currenty looking throught <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012">CS253 - Web Application Engineering</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Huffman">Steve Huffman</a> (the creator of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit.com</a>) just as a free course, to play a little more with Python and Google App Engine.<br />
</p><p>I highly recomend you to pickup some course today. And once again, thanks a lot to <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> for that priceless opportunity to learn!<br />

<p>            Two years ago I&#8217;ve concluded an interesting research. I was thinking how much employers care about hiring developers with TDD skills while looking for suitable candidates. As output of this research I&#8217;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/TddDemand">simple crawler</a>, that is able to crawl vacancy web sites and perform the simple analysis does this vacancy description require TDD skill or not. As well, I&#8217;ve created some <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/09/is-tdd-skill-actually-required-by.html">blog posts</a>, where I did share results + some technical issues I met during building this crawler. <br />
        </p>        <p>            At the weekend, I&#8217;ve decided to repeat this experiment. The code of crawler worked perfectly, except some correction I had to apply to conform the markup changes of sites that happed through these two years. Leaving the technical part of this blog post, I want to share the results with you.    <br />
        </p>        <h2>What was at 2010?</h2>        <p>            Let&#8217;s recap what it was at 2010. I&#8217;ve crawled 978 records from <a href="http://rabota.ua">rabota.ua</a> site and 150 of 978 (about 15%) contained TDD requirement. For <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a> the results was a little better, ~23% (49 of 212) contained some mention on TDD. <br />
        </p>        <p>            The quote from 2 year ago report:<br />
        </p>        <blockquote>            .. such demand on TDD could be reasonable for countries like Ukraine, where major market is for maintenance of existing code base (typically legacy code, no tests). But we see similar figures for USA, country where a lot of brand new product born.<br />
        </blockquote>        <p>            I believe the awareness of TDD and general software quality got higher along the way. But let&#8217;s see the figures of 2012.<br />
        </p>        <h2>What we have in 2012?</h2>        <p>            This time I got a litle more data. 1067 records of <a href="http://rabota.ua">rabota.ua</a> and 560 records of <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a>. But what about demand? <br />
        </p>        <p>            All right, it&#8217;s only 77 vacancies of 1067 is requiring TDD, which is 7.22% in <a href="http://rabota.ua">rabota.ua</a>. <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a> has 127 vacancies requiring TDD which is 22.68%.<br />
        </p>        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rCsIO8n52dA/T85IV89lIHI/AAAAAAAAI0w/bxk4W_s9qyQ/s581/chart-1.png"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rCsIO8n52dA/T85IV89lIHI/AAAAAAAAI0w/bxk4W_s9qyQ/s581/chart-1.png" style="width: 620px"/></a><br />
        <p>            The technologies breakdown is follows. Java leads as a technology with the highest demand on TDD. During this post creation I thought that my results does include JavaScript, which gain much popularity recently. It&#8217;s interesting to see what&#8217;s there.<br />
        </p>        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UyPYP1GoBtE/T85IVyrtlJI/AAAAAAAAI04/-9EpSPtx1hs/s906/chart-2.png"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UyPYP1GoBtE/T85IVyrtlJI/AAAAAAAAI04/-9EpSPtx1hs/s906/chart-2.png" style="width: 620px"/></a><br />
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>        <p>            Ukrainian market demand lowered almost twice. USA market demand is stable, with a little change which is almost the noise.<br />
        </p>        <ul>            <li>Ukraine: 2010 -> 15.34%, 2012 -> 7.22% ( -8.12% )</li>
            <li>USA: 2010 -> 23.11%, 2012 -> 22.68% ( -0.43% )</li>
        </ul>        <p>            I can see very low demand on TDD in C/C++ field. Almost equal demand between Java and .NET with a slight win of Java. <br />
        </p>        <p>            I personally wanted to see different figures. Anyway, it was interesting to see actual results and restored some code that worked 2 years ago. Probably this analysis required to be done more frequently to have a kind of valuable statistics.  <br />

<p>            During my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/search/label/CS101">CS101</a> class I first time meet Python. That&#8217;s not completely true, since I played a bit Python before, but I had a chance to see Python in action only during this course. In short, that was really pleasant meet up and I hope it will grown up to prolonged and mutual relationships. I will share some &#8216;likes&#8217; and &#8216;dislikes&#8217; about Python, which I would think you find interesting.<br />
        </p>        <h2>What I liked in Python&#8230;</h2>        <p>            Python is very well known language with great reputation and community around it. Big companies, including Google, using python to build enterprise level applications. Hackers love Python cause it combines both simplicity and power. You can do any kind of application development including desktop and web applications. All the time is being compared to Ruby, which is for me ends up to something like <a href="http://grokcode.com/746/dear-python-why-are-you-so-ugly/">this</a> only.<br />
        </p>        <h3>No IDE development</h3>        <p>            You don&#8217;t need any kind of fancy IDE to start up with Python. Sure, IDE is something that makes development more efficient, so if you going to do a lot of programming with Python including debugging you should probably pick one. But for now, I&#8217;m totally happy with Sublime Text 2 as IDE.  <br />
        </p>        <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rjt33byD0RU/T8pJrIcP5fI/AAAAAAAAI0k/SDaO2hXb2JI/s800/image-1.png"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rjt33byD0RU/T8pJrIcP5fI/AAAAAAAAI0k/SDaO2hXb2JI/s800/image-1.png" alt="Sublime Text 2 for Python" style="width: 620px"/></a><br />
        <h3>Easy to learn</h3>        <p>            If you know some OO language like C++ or Java, it will be quick jump to Python. Python is object-oriented language but with support of different paradigms as procedural and even functional programming. The basic concepts of variables, conditions and control flow are the same as you get used to. Of course, you spend sometime to know the fundaments - like, how to compare things, how to calculate length of string or list, how to put element into dictionary. Sometimes, I still refer to documentation, but in general all that things are easy to remember with practice.<br />
        </p>        <h3>Interpretation and dynamic typing</h3>        <p>            Python is interpretator. You never mention the type of object as you declare it or use it. You might apply different operations on object, it would be evaluated on runtime. There are different opinions (holy wars) on Static vs. Dynamic, but as for me with Dynamic languages the overall development velocity is higher. First of all, you don&#8217;t spend any time for compilation, which in case of big solutions could be really high. Second, as you are only to able to check results as code executed (even if you just misspell variable name you will know about it only if this code section is evaluated), you are more focused on unit tests and TDD to catch up obvious issues, which in general makes development faster.  <br />
        </p>        <h3>Built in types</h3>        <p>            Python has complete built-in types system. For numbers you can use different types, as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>complex</code>. The type is evaluated on runtime,<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            i = 0               # integer
            j = 1.0             # float
            x = complex(1, -1)  # complex
        </pre>        <p>            Strings are everything inside the &#8221; quotes,<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            str = "I'm string"
        </pre>        <p>            Btw, during the course I got conclusion that list is the most flexible data structure. Everything you need, you can build upon lists. Lists are nicely handled with Python,<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            l = [ 1, 2, 'three', [4, 5], [[6, 7], 8]   
        </pre>        <p>            Lists are non-optimal for searches, so if you do a lot of searches you might consider using dictionary,<br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            d = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': [3] }
        </pre>        <p>            Each type has it&#8217;s own set of methods. Strings including common operations as concatenation, trimming, substring found etc. For list and dictionaries there are bunch of useful stuff as getting iterators, pushing and poping of elements.<br />
        </p>        <h3>Syntax and Code styles</h3>        <p>            Syntax and Code styles are commonly another topic of holy war. Fortunately, Python leaves very few room for that. First of all - no semicolons. Second, Python uses indentation as part of language syntax. So, poorly indented code would simply won&#8217;t work.  <br />
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            def my_method_name(arg1, arg2):
                return arg1 < arg2              # right
                
            def my_method_name(arg1, arg2):
            return arg1 < arg                   # won't work!
            
            def my_method(arg1, arg2):
                if arg1 < arg2:
                    return arg1 + arg2          # right
            
                if arg1 == arg2:
                print arg2                      # won't work!
        </pre>
        <p>            Basically, everything that is after &#8220;:&#8221; have to be indented. This is for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code> etc. Using tab instead of curvy braces (or any other symbol or term) is really nice idea, allowing to keep code in the same format and &#8216;forcing&#8217; one and solid code guidelines along the projects and teams.
        </p>        <h2>What I disliked in Python&#8230;</h2>        <p>            There are no perfect things, moreover perfect languages. Developers have their own habits and opinions on different things. In Python I see several things that makes me little uncomfortable about.
        </p>        <h2>Naming consistency</h2>        <p>            It sounds like Python adopts C code styles for naming of methods and variables, like <code>longes_cycle</code> or <code>def make_it_work()</code>. But in reality a lot of methods are violating those rules. For instance some methods of dictionary type: <code>fromkeys()</code>, <code>iteritems()</code>, <code>setdefault()</code>. In the same time dict contains the method: <code>has_key()</code>.
        </p>        <p>            That&#8217;s very annoying. Especially if you don&#8217;t have any IDE with names suggesting, it makes it really hard to remember.
        </p>        <h2>Booleans and None</h2>        <p>            Almost the same as in topic above. Having the C-style (with a lower first symbol) language designers decided to have a special cases. 
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            a = True        # why not true ?
            b = False       # why not false ?
            x = None        # none ?
        </pre>        <p>            So, in code which is in general lower case, those True/False/None looking really strange.
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            def proc3(input_list):
                if len(input_list) == 0:
                    return None

                for i in range(0, len(input_list)):
                    for j in range(0, len(input_list)):
                        if input_list[i] == input_list[j] and i != j:
                            return False
                return True
        </pre>        <h3>OO but not OO</h3>        <p>            Being OO language, Python still relies on some procedural concepts. The good example is calculation of string length. I would expect, that string corresponding method <code>len()</code> or something, but instead we are having &#8216;global&#8217; function that does that. 
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            s = "I'm string"
            print len(s)        # why not s.len() ?
        </pre>        <p>            <code>len()</code> is overloaded for other types, it would work for list and dictionaries as well,
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            l = [1, 2, 3]
            d = { 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3 }
            
            print len(l)
            print len(d)
        </pre>        <p>            In the same manner, if you what to get reverse iterator for collection, I would assume there corresponding method that returns that iterator. Bad guess,
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            l = [1, 2, 3]
            for e in reverse(l):    # why l.reverse()
                print e
        </pre>        <h3>__init__() method</h3>        <p>            Trying out classes in Python first you need to understand is how to construct an object. Python has constructor, that look like that, 
        </p>        <pre class="brush: python">            class MyClass:
                def __init__(self, a, b):
                    self.a = a
                    self.b = b
        </pre>        <p>            I could understand it would be <code>init</code> or <code>_init</code> or <code>constructor</code>, but I will probably never understand <code>__init__</code> with 2 underscores before and after. It&#8217;s ugly.
        </p>        <h2>Conclusions</h2>        <p>            I&#8217;m about to enroll to next Udactity courses, so my Python journey continues. I hope to get more in language and standard library.

<p>        <small><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this blog post expresses some impressions and details of Udacity CS101 &#8220;Building a Search Engine&#8221; online course. If you are either currently participating it or plan to do so in nearest future, this blog post could be a spoiler. Even though, I&#8217;m trying to make it generic as possible and do not spoil important things.<br />
        </small><br />
    </p>    <p>        With a quite delay I&#8217;ve concluded units 5 and 6. I&#8217;m in a big rush now, since the exam week is already started, but I&#8217;ve not yet completed Unit 7. Fortunately, Unit 7 is not technical one, but rather common computer science education, that helps to shape all knowledge received through seven weeks together.     <br />
    </p>    <p>        I would say that those 2 units is something where I start to feel some complexity. In Unit 5 we focused on making things faster, basically by introduction more advanced data structures for the same job. We went from a list based index implementation to self-implemented hash table and then utilized the Python dictionary type. Again, abstracting out of many simple things is what good developer should always do, but I was surprised how many things I forgot about main properties of hash functions and hash tables. We were also did a very basic algorithms analysis stuff. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Unit 6 is a real computer science. Besides of the playing with recursive algorithms we did more advanced things as graph theory. All of that was a fundamentals for implementing Pang Ranking mechanism. We used famous Google&#8217;s (Larry Page&#8217;s) algorithm that everybody heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>. This is where my brains start to heat. Will be honest with you, I still missing it&#8217;s some parts, so it will take some time get the clear picture about it.  <br />
    </p>    <p>        So, the crawler starts to have real search engine features. Not only extracting links and indexing the keywords, that&#8217;s definitely not enough for search engine. But building the links graph and computing page ranks, that then used in lookup functions to provide the best choice on search keyword. It&#8217;s very simplified but working model of something that Google have (probably something that Google <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">might have</a> back in 1998).  <br />
    </p>    <p>        Python. I like language more and more and start to feel some confidence. In the same time there are several things that I dislike. Not so serious, almost cosmetic.. but something that a little bugs me a little.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Anyway, I have only few days now to submit my exam works. I already glanced on exam tasks and they don&#8217;t appear to much complex, so I have good chances to be in time with it. Wish me a good luck! I&#8217;ll update you as soon as I got any results! <br />

<p>Some time ago I&#8217;ve posted an article called <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/07/how-to-be-better-developer-or-3.html">How to be better developer or 3 accounts rule</a> where I shared my vision on importance of having some accounts if you care about professionalism and mastery. The basic idea there is you have to produce a lot, you have to write a lot. You have to write code, write blog posts and help people on forums.<br />
</p><p>If you have seen one of the latest Scott Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ItsNotWhatYouReadItsWhatYouIgnoreVideoOfScottHanselmansPersonalProductivityTips.aspx">Productivity Tips</a> video, you probably heard nice metaphor about the &#8220;Limit of Keystrokes&#8221;. It sounds really funny, Scott saying - &#8220;everybody is having limited count of keystokes, if you reach you count - you dead&#8221;. That means, we have to think on each keystroke we do with much care. <br />
</p><p>And the most efficient usage of keystrokes is for learning. Reading is very important, but nowadays there are so many information that you just not able to consume everything. That&#8217;s why recently I&#8217;ve unsubscribed a lot of RSS channels in my Google Reader, I think I will filter the Twitter as well. Instead, I try to read as few things as possible. Not only read, but try them on practice. Just write some small code to try the idea, pattern, approach of framework. Turning the theory in practice is something that gives me much fun and satisfaction.<br />
</p><p>Yesterday, we were doing Coding Dojo with good friend of mine <a href="http://twitter.com/skalinets">@skalinets</a> on <a href="http://agilebasecamp.org/">Agile Base Camp</a> conference. Instead of going my default language (which is C# for now) I paired the PHP guy. We were doing String Calculator kata in PHP. It was so great! First of all, I amazed how much PHP improved since the last time I looked on it (about 10 years ago), second is that I used my keystrokes to learn something new. <br />
</p><p>Writing the code for fun and learning has a huge value. This is definitely good investment of the keystrokes.  <br />

<p>        For quite long time Windows users of github had a huge envy towards <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a> - the application that makes work with github based repositories as simple as possible. A lot of people, especially ones who are not familiar with Git, experiencing some issues with github initially. No surprise, extensive command-line, SSH, public/private keys - might sound scary for GUI addicted persons. <br />
    </p>    <p>       December 2011, Phil Haack <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/12/07/hello-github.aspx">joined</a> github.. so, the world hold the breath, to see what actually will be done by Phil and team to improve overall Github experience on Windows. And the day has come! Today <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Github:Windows</a> is officially shipped.<br />
    </p>    <h2>What&#8217;s the point?</h2>    <p>        As well as Mac users, Windows users are also much got used to UI. For long time, if you want to deal with Git on windows, you have to go and install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a>. It&#8217;s a great product and works great actually, but you have to spend some time of learning of Git to do very basics operations. Moreover, if you hadn&#8217;t had any experience with distributed version control systems - you&#8217;ll be to much confused by new words like: pull, push, clone, fork, cherry-pick and so on. <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Github for Windows</a> is about to fix that.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Go ahead and install it</h2>    <p>        Installation is very easy. Just click the <a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/setup.exe">download</a> link, to get web setup file. Two things are gonna installed on you machine: Github client itself and Git shell - the powershell command line for git.<br />
    </p>    <h2>        Github for Windows client<br />
    </h2>    <p>        At the first run it will do some configuration stuff. It will ask you for github credentials.<br />

    <p>        As you logged on, it will show you some basic account information.<br />
    </p>    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cF3gaHlxPYE/T7qZuqR6clI/AAAAAAAAIuI/gE6-xxhKd58/s1024/page-2.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    <p>        It will also add new public SSH key your account. That was a little unexpected as I received email notification for github about that. The information that it&#8217;s gonna do that, probably should be mentioned during setup. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Then it tries to locate all repositories. It scans the home folder, but I don&#8217;t keeping repositories there (just some temp copies), so I unselected everything.<br />
    </p>    <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E-6YmkuP9M8/T7qZufRug-I/AAAAAAAAIuE/ifq-o89_Eio/s1024/page-3.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    <p>        As I tried to go straight and create new repository the application crashed. Oppps.. It reproduced several times, but after gone. Anyway, I contacted <a href="mailto:support@github.com">support@github.com</a> with detailed steps and info.    <br />
    </p>    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v4EcFQZzPeo/T7qZvPSQdmI/AAAAAAAAIuQ/FYaM5NvP8_c/s1024/page-4.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    <p>        Finally, after I changed the default folder and wait till it&#8217;s completed scanned (that took about 3 mins on my machine), I got client working.<br />
    </p>    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VWSpIa020_g/T7qZvVqLnTI/AAAAAAAAIuc/xSuOGL0NWJs/s1024/page-6.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    <p>        Even if I&#8217;m not huge fan of METRO style - I was really pleased with UI. It looks very nice, application works fast and responsive. It takes almost no effort to overview application features.. everything is very intuitive.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It&#8217;s of course not the perfect. I tried to do some commits, that seems to be fine.. but sync of the repo failed. It also fails to switch the branches in 95% cases.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Git Shell for command line</h2>    <p>        Next good addition is Git Shell, powered by PowerShell (nice!). It utilizes famous <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a> project. The most useful features for me now: &#8216;Tab&#8217; support that provides suggestion for the command and &#8216;Stats&#8217; that are shown at command prompt, showing current repository state. There are probably a lot of other cool things there, that I haven&#8217;t discovered yet.<br />
    </p>    <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HOCSvGnNXnQ/T7qhpOr91rI/AAAAAAAAIu0/xwFjs8dvw_Q/s678/page-7.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    <p>        If you are fan of Bash, or pure Cmd.. or custom stuff (as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Console 2</a>) it very easy to change that, right in application configuration.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        Even if it&#8217;s just first release, it&#8217;s very solid and a lot of features already there. Issues exist, but I hope it will be cleared out soon.<br />
    </p>    <p>        What make me a little wonder, that the project is not open sourced? I hope it&#8217;s just the question of time, I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of people are waiting to see what&#8217;s inside and submit some pull requests.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Will I personally use that product? Probably, not. I&#8217;ve spent too many time in Command-line of my favorite <a href="http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en">Far Manager</a>, that UI is more noise that help. What I will use is Git Shell, thought. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about posh-git, now it&#8217;s  time to try.<br />
    </p>    <p>    But for all people, who are just starting using Github on Window - <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Github:Windows</a> would be my first recommendation.<br />

If you are either currently participating it or plan to do so in nearest future, this blog post could be a spoiler. Even though, I&#8217;m trying to make it generic as possible and do not spoil important things.<br />
</small><br />
</p><p>I&#8217;ve got completed Unit 4 of course during this week. It&#8217;s getting more and more interesting and the crawler we building there getting more complicated. <br />
</p><p>This week we got through the basic data structures, mainly based on lists. The most interesting thing was an index data structure, thought. We&#8217;ve built the simple page indexer. Now the result of crawling is not simply the list of crawled links, but instead is index that keeps track of content (as word) and the URL where the word is mention. If some of you don&#8217;t know what the index is, the simplest explanation is get just to open any technical book. At the end of the book you will see &#8220;Index&#8221; section. By looking for information you have to option. Either go from one page to another, finding keyword appearance.. or go to index and see exact pages, where this keyword is mentioned. Indices are essential for quick search of data.<br />
</p><p>The index that my crawler produce, crawling the <a href="http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html">test page</a> is:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: python">[['This', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['is', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['a', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['test', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['page', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['for', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['learning', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']], 
   ['to', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html', 'http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/crawling.html']], 
   ['crawl!', ['http://www.udacity.com/cs101x/index.html']]
   # ...
    </pre><p>I went a little above the given task and improved the crawler with &#8220;clean-up html tags&#8221; functionality. So, I get the body part of document, strip out all HTML tags and then index the content. The latest version of crawler is in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/2757731">gist</a>.<br />
</p><p>We also looked on some Internet fundamentals as: bandwidth, latency, traceroutes and protocols. <br />
</p><p>I haven&#8217;t yet started any project on python except the crawler one. With implementing the of more complex applications I start to feel the lack of IDE with debugger. I currently use Sublime Text 2 + print statement as my IDE and debugger tool. It might be time to look for something better.<br />
</p><p>Everything is going fine so far, except the fact I&#8217;m being late for one week. The final exam is going to be posted at 27th of May and it will take one week to have a change to pass it. So, I&#8217;ve got a goal to complete 2 units through this week. The half of course is done! <br />
