<p>        There are different approaches of how to create object in JavaScript. C# and Java programmers are commonly starting with creation by new operator, since it very close to same practice they got used to.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">function Person (name) {
    this.name = name;
}

var person = new Person('John Smith');
console.log(person.name);
    </pre>    <p>        If you try to run this code, you will see &#8216;John Smith&#8217; in console. Now, try to delete new operator.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Instead of &#8216;John Smith&#8217; you will see undefined. Why?<br />
    </p>    <p>        The difference is that without new operator it is just function call. During the call `this` points global namespace. If you running the code in browser, global namespace is bind to `window`.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It&#8217;s important to understand how new operator works. Internally, operator new is converted to NEW(Person, &#8216;John Smith&#8217;);. It does several things.<br />
    </p>    <ol>        <li>Creates new native object and initializes the __proto__ of object by function.prototype.</li>
        <li>Calls function, applying newly created object as value for <code>this</code>.</li>
        <li>Returns newly created object.</li>
    </ol>    <p>        It can be expressed in this kind of pseudo-code:<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">function NEW(f) {
    var obj = { '__proto__': f.prototype };
    f.apply(obj, arguments.slice(1));
    return obj;
}
</pre>    <p>        (It&#8217;s a bit more complex actually, for details check this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6750880/javascript-how-does-new-work-internally">great answer</a> on SO).<br />
    </p>    <p>        It means that during function call with `new operator()`, <code>this</code> always points to a new object, created based on function prototype. You can initialize the properties of new object inside the function. It&#8217;s no longer a simple function, but it is constructing function, or more simply - constructor.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To distinguish between constructors (that are always supposed to be called with `new`) and simple function, there is a convention to name a constructors with capital first letter (not person(), but Person()), just to give you some tips while you writing the code.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Knowing NEW() details of work and following simple conventions for constructors will help you to understand language better and prevent many stupid errors.<br />

    <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Elmah.MVC">ELMAH MVC 2.0.2</a> has been just pushed recently. This is a contribution by <a href="https://github.com/jamescrowley">James Crowley</a> which adds a special configuration key that prevents ELMAH.MVC to setup a global `HandleErrorAttribute()`. It&#8217;s in particular useful, than you already setup some configuration inside the app, so you don&#8217;t want default behavior.<br />
</p><p>Inside the <code>web.config</code> file you will find a configuration setting for that.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain">&lt;appSettings&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.disableHandler&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.disableHandleErrorFilter&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.requiresAuthentication&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.allowedRoles&quot; value=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;add key=&quot;elmah.mvc.route&quot; value=&quot;elmah&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
    </pre><p>It is <code>elmah.mvc.disableHandleErrorFilter</code>. By default it&#8217;s `false`, meaning `HandleErrorAttribute()` from ELMAH.MVC is used. To disable it, just set <code>true</code> to this setting.<br />
</p><p>And btw, it&#8217;s already 30.000 downloads of NuGet package! Huge number, thanks a lot for all users and contributors.<br />

    <p>        Let&#8217;s go back for a moment for <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2012/10/baby-steps-to-backbonejs-starting-up.html">previous</a> post where we started to bootstrap some basic Backbone.js application. It&#8217;s very simple now, just gathering all data and posting those data to server.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Any reliable system is almost impossible without validation. If some field is required or must conform to some particular rule, it should be validated as soon as possible and validation information should be displayed to user. User then applies corrections and re-submit data.<br />
    </p>    <p>        In case of `Feedback` model, we are interested that user always input her email and feedback message. Backbone.js provides very straight forward for models validation. If model requires validation, it should implement <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Model-validate">validate</a> method.<br />
    </p>    <p>        So, let&#8217;s extend our model with validate method.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var Feedback = Backbone.Model.extend({
    url: '/feedback',

    defaults: {
        'email': '',
        'website': '',
        'feedback': ''
    },

    validate: function (attrs) {
        if (!attrs.email) {
            return 'Please fill email field.';
        }
        if (!attrs.feedback) {
            return 'Please fill feedback field.';
        }
    }
});
    </pre>    <p>        As you can see, in case of email or feedback is missing, we just simply return string with error message.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To better understand what&#8217;s going on, let&#8217;s look on some piece of the code from Backbone.js framework. Namely, to `_validate` method of `Backbone.Model`, which is actually responsible for validation.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">_validate: function(attrs, options) {
    if (options.silent || !this.validate) return true;
    attrs = _.extend({}, this.attributes, attrs);
    var error = this.validate(attrs, options);
    if (!error) return true;
    if (options && options.error) {
       options.error(this, error, options);
    } else {
        this.trigger('error', this, error, options);
    }
    return false;
}
</pre>    <p>        You can see, if `validate` returns either undefined or null or false, `_validate` just returns true - meaning the model is valid. Otherwise, it would check if `options.error` function initialized and call it, if not model event `error` is triggered.<br />
    </p>    <p>        During the model saving, we typically provide both success and error callbacks. It means, that error callback will be called, if model does not pass validation requirements. Inside the callback, we might decided what to do with errors. Right now, let&#8217;s just do alert.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var options = {
    success: function () {
        alert('Thanks for the feedback!');
    },
    error: function (model, error) {
        alert(error);
    }
};

var feedback = {
    email: this.$('#email').val(),
    website:  this.$('#website').val(),
    feedback: this.$('#feedback').val()
};

this.model.save(feedback, options);
    </pre>    <p>        Notice that `error` callback receiving model itself as first argument and error object (one returned from `validate` method) as second argument. Let&#8217;s try this code: leave email and feedback fields empty and press submit button.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BtV9yCmh3T8/UJtgc5Nk4CI/AAAAAAAALnQ/d671woxZwrE/s621/image-1.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BtV9yCmh3T8/UJtgc5Nk4CI/AAAAAAAALnQ/d671woxZwrE/s621/image-1.png"/><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        There are several drawback of such implementation, though. First of all, `alert` windows are awful, second if user corrects email, next time she presses the submit button next alert with another message appears. This is terrible UX, so let&#8217;s fix it.<br />
    </p>    <p>        So, we should basically do 2 things: aggregate all errors during validation and apply some nice styles to errors.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Instead of returning simple strings, we&#8217;ll return an array of objects, containing name of failed and field and message.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">validate: function (attrs) {
    var errors = [];

    if (!attrs.email) {
        errors.push({name: 'email', message: 'Please fill email field.'});
    }
    if (!attrs.feedback) {
        errors.push({name: 'feedback', message: 'Please fill feedback field.'});
    }

    return errors.length > 0 ? errors : false;
}
</pre>    <p>        Change the `save` method options, to show errors if any error appeared and hide errors if save was successful. <br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var me = this;
var options = {
    success: function () {
        me.hideErrors();
    },
    error: function (model, errors) {
        me.showErrors(errors);
    }
};
</pre>    <p>        And implement 2 simple methods:<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">showErrors: function(errors) {
    _.each(errors, function (error) {
        var controlGroup = this.$('.' + error.name);
        controlGroup.addClass('error');
        controlGroup.find('.help-inline').text(error.message);
    }, this);
},

hideErrors: function () {
    this.$('.control-group').removeClass('error');
    this.$('.help-inline').text('');
}
</pre>    <p>        Let&#8217;s test the code. As all fields are left empty, it will look like,<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qPbTz5Cl0N4/UJtgc8JU-1I/AAAAAAAALnU/ru1sJb6j6V4/s717/image-2.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qPbTz5Cl0N4/UJtgc8JU-1I/AAAAAAAALnU/ru1sJb6j6V4/s717/image-2.png"></img><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        As fields are filled and form submitted, all errors are cleared from form.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        That was very simple &#8220;baby-step&#8221; style of approaching model validation. I would could it, validation &#8220;from the box&#8221;. Even if it&#8217;s very useful there are a lot of different approaches of making even things better. The source code is availble on <a href="https://gist.github.com/4037415">github</a>.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Stay tuned for next Backbone.js baby steps soon.<br />

    <p>        Suppose you have a list of resources that you would like to retrieve by means of AJAX. `$.ajax()` (or it&#8217;s short variants like `$.get()` or `$.post`) is usual way of making AJAX calls, it works great than you need to fetch one.<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var url = '/api/resource/1';
$.get(url, function (r) {
    // use response
});
    </pre>    <p>        Even in case of several it might be still usable,<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var url1 = '/api/resource/1';
var url2 = '/api/resource/2'
$.get(url1, function (r) {
    // use response from url1

    $.get(url1, function (r) {
        // use response from url2
    });
});
    </pre>    <p>        You can easily see, if you have more than 3 you are trapping into &#8220;callback hell&#8221;. Furthermore, if you have a list of url&#8217;s to fetch and the size of that list is dynamic, it&#8217;s not even possible to build structure like that.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Not long time a ago, I&#8217;ve been exactly into this situation. So, I have a list of resources to fetch, I need to issue them one-by-one and I want to have only one callback, that would pass all fetched resources in one object. Initially I thought it&#8217;s not even possible, at least with-out creation of some ugly code. But with great help of my colleagues the problem been solved. <br />
    </p>    <p>        jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">Deferred Object</a> is something I&#8217;ve head about, but never got a change to play with. It turn&#8217;s out to be very nice and simple idea. Deferred allows you to build chainable constructions. Actually, `$.ajax()` always returns deferred object, so you can apply `.done()`, `.fail()` functions on it.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Here is the code, that you could be re-usable in the same situation;<br />
    </p>    <pre class="brush: js">var pipedAjaxRequests = function (urls, callback) {
 var responses = {};

 var promise = $.Deferred().resolve();
 _.each(urls, function (url) {
  promise = promise.pipe(function () {
   return $.get(url);
  }).done(function (response) {
   responses[url] = response;
  });
 });

 promise.done(function () {
  callback(responses);
 }).fail(function (err) {
  callback(responses, err);
 });
};
</pre>    <p>        It does create the pipe of `$.get()` calls and place the responses in one response object. At the time then all resources are fetched, the callback is called. In case of errors, second parameter of callback will have error info.<br />

    <p>Many times then I speak to people regarding usage of any kind of MV* frameworks on front-end I hear common objection: &#8220;but we already have a lot of code written on jQuery/Dojo/Whatever, I think usage of additional framework would be impossible&#8221;. This is not actually true. Backbone is very lightweight and could fit into any existing application.<br />
</p><p>Baby steps strategy is the most efficient way of trying the things. You start with something really small, enhance it over the time and expand for other application areas. Now, let&#8217;s imagine you got an existing application, you wish to start using Backbone.js to improve that. I would like to show you, that it&#8217;s absolutely possible.<br />
</p><p>Suppose, you want to add a feedback form for your app. Let&#8217;s implement that with Backbone.js.<br />
</p><h2>Applications, Models, Views</h2><p>There are no such thing as `Controller` in Backbone.js. But you have to have some kind of entry point, some place with `main()` function inside. I got used to call this place - Application. Basically, the application is a module, which is responsible for initialization of model, instantiation of view, rendering the view.<br />
</p><p>The `Model` is object that holds the data. It could be fetched and persisted back to server.<br />
</p><p>And finally view is object that produces markup, hooking up events and updates View from data in Model and otherwise.<br />
</p><p>We are going to create all three things. It makes a lot of sense to breakdown the folder structure of to reflect logical meaning of each entity of Backbone application. So, we&#8217;ll create 3 folders for apps, models and views.<br />

</a><br />
<h2>Setup Backbone.js</h2><p>On a target html page we should place 2 additional script tags.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/libs/underscore.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/libs/backbone.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre><p>Besides of that, let&#8217;s add one more div. The one that application will be using for rendering views.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot; class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre><h2>Application entry point</h2><p>Let&#8217;s create a new file in `apps` folder and call it `FeedbackFormApp.js`. It would be very simple.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">$(function () {
    var model = new Feedback();
    var view = new FeedbackFormView ({model: model});
    
    $('#app').html(view.render().el);
});
    </pre><p>Then DOM is ready, we instantiate new model object and view and render the form into DOM element with id - app.<br />
</p><h2>Feedback model</h2><p>Now, let&#8217;s define a model. Create a new file in models folder and call it `Feedback.js`.<br />
</p><p>The model refects the data we are collecting/displaying to user and it&#8217;s typically stored on server (sometimes on localstorage). Feedback model will include 3 attributes: email of user, his web site and the feedback text. In terms of Backbone.js that would mean.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">var Feedback = Backbone.Model.extend({

    url: '/feedback',

    defaults: {
        'email': '',
        'website': '',
        'feedback': ''
    }

});
    </pre><p>The <code>url</code> property of model object is used by Backbone for persisting object to server. The <code>default</code> are defaults values for model attributes.<br />
</p><h2>Rendering the view</h2><p>The most interesting things in Backbone.js app is happening in Views. Add new file to `views` folder - FeedbackView.js.<br />
</p><p>The skeleton of view would look like this:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">var FeedbackFormView = Backbone.View.extend({
   className: 'row',

    render: function () {
        return this;
    }
});
    </pre><p>This view, does do nothing. So, let make it render the template. The template would be very simple form.<br />
</p><p>There are different approaches, there to actually place the markup. It&#8217;s possible to place it in the same .html file where view starts and extract it by jQuery, it&#8217;s possible to place to separate file and load it asynchronously by $.get(). But, according to baby steps scenario - we&#8217;ll place it directly to .js file. So, inside the view we&#8217;ll add property called template.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">template: '\
 &lt;form&gt;\
  &lt;legend&gt;Share the feedback&lt;/legend&gt;\
  &lt;div class=&quot;control-group&quot;&gt;\
   &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\
   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Your email address...&quot;&gt;\
  &lt;/div&gt;\
  &lt;div class=&quot;control-group&quot;&gt;\
   &lt;label&gt;Web site&lt;/label&gt;\
   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;website&quot; placeholder=&quot;Your website...&quot;&gt;\
  &lt;/div&gt;\
  &lt;div class=&quot;control-group&quot;&gt;\
  &lt;label&gt;Feedback&lt;/label&gt;\
  &lt;textarea id=&quot;feedback&quot; class=&quot;input-xxlarge&quot; placeholder=&quot;Feedback text...&quot; rows=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\
  &lt;/div&gt;\
  &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; id=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\
 &lt;/form&gt;\
',
    </pre><p>And render method, would be:<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">render: function () {
    this.$el.html(this.template);

    return this;
}
    </pre><h2>First test</h2><p>Basically, we are ready to see some results. Modify the target view by adding references to model and view.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/src/models/Feedback.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/src/views/FeedbackFormView.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/src/apps/FeedbackFormApp.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre><p>Fire up the application and go to target page. You should be able to see something like this (for styles I use <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> here).<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-asgv034ZUyA/UImU8iURcEI/AAAAAAAAKZ4/9Yga2hCy9TQ/s620/image-2.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-asgv034ZUyA/UImU8iURcEI/AAAAAAAAKZ4/9Yga2hCy9TQ/s620/image-2.png"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>If you see the form on screen, it means application started properly.<br />
</p><h2>Submitting the form</h2><p>We enter the data into input fields and as soon as data is in-place we are ready to submit. It means we have to catch an event of `Submit` button click and store the model to server.<br />
</p><p>To explain to Backbone.js that you interested in particular DOM event, you need to add another property to view. It is called <code>events</code>.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">events: {
    'click #submit': 'submitClicked'
},
    </pre><p>You can read it as - if click happed to element with id `submit`, call function submitClicked.<br />
</p><pre class="brush: js">submitClicked: function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    var options = {
        success: function () {
            alert('Thanks for the feedback!');
        },
        error: function () {
            alert('Opps, your feedback has not been submitted, please try again.');
        }
    };

    var feedback = {
        email: this.$('#email').val(),
        website:  this.$('#website').val(),
        feedback: this.$('#feedback').val()
    };

    this.model.save(feedback, options);
}
</pre><p>What it does, is first of all prevent the default behavior of event. So, the form would not be actually posted to server. Second, it prepares the options object&#8217;s with success and error handlers. After we initialize all attributes with actual values from corresponding inputs/textbox. And finally we call model.save().<br />
</p><h2>Second test</h2><p>Fire up application again. Now, if have properly set-up server side to receive the HTTP post call to `/feedback` you actually post first feedback.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xoKGopfbwlw/UImU8rspz_I/AAAAAAAAKZ8/8D3bgfnRpgE/s620/image-3.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xoKGopfbwlw/UImU8rspz_I/AAAAAAAAKZ8/8D3bgfnRpgE/s620/image-3.png"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>From my server trace, I can see that new object is received.<br />
</p><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FPoQZTARH0g/UImU9HR4aHI/AAAAAAAAKaA/fhPj64h6cr8/s621/image-4.png"><br />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FPoQZTARH0g/UImU9HR4aHI/AAAAAAAAKaA/fhPj64h6cr8/s621/image-4.png"/><br />
</a><br />
<p>Now, it&#8217;s the server job to put to storage, allocate the id etc.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>In this first baby step, I just showed how it&#8217;s possible to adopt Backbone.js for existing apps. It does not make a lot of sense to re-write your existing code with Backbone.js, but new widgets/elements/applications could be created with Backbone, having a benefit of it&#8217;s structural approach.<br />
</p><p>I&#8217;ll go on with baby steps, showing other features of Backbone.js.<br />

<p>Four days ago my twitter has been nuked. The bomb has exploded after <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> site link has reach to top of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4597716">Hacker News</a> and people watched the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript">video of Anders Hejlsberg</a> who generally described the language features and showed some example. Everybody were talking about TypeScript.<br />
</p><p>For ones who missed the video (I can&#8217;t believe you did) I shortly describe - TypeScript in new open source project, by Microsoft. It&#8217;s leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg</a> is very famous developer (my bad, I always forget his name), creator of C# and one of the persons who most influenced .NET platform. TypeScript compiled down to JavaScript, but it introduce the types checking during compilation, so it could be called &#8216;static typed language&#8217;.<br />
</p><p>First of all, TypeScript is definitely <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">not the first language</a>, that complies to JavaScript. It&#8217;s not the first one that augments JavaScript with new statements like class, interface or module. So, what&#8217;s so interesting on it?<br />
</p><p>I&#8217;ve been using static type languages for about 10 years. I&#8217;ve very much got used to compiler error messages and truly believed that it helps to build applications. Meaning, the complier is first guard towards the &#8216;good&#8217; code. To the code that could be called reliable, error free. <br />
</p><p>But situation much changed after I start programming JavaScript. <br />
</p><p>I feel myself quite productive with using of using JavaScript. Of cause, there are some best practice & patters are collected nowadays, we have better tools, faster engines and JavaScript has been so much adopted by community. But JavaScript is indeed, so powerful language. I really like the dynamic typing, that bit more forces to unit testing, making code changes more easy in the same time creating some very beautiful code structures.<br />
</p><p>I know that some people are saying, &#8220;we don&#8217;t need any static typing for JavaScript; please don&#8217;t change the language&#8221;. Such developers could be called &#8220;purists&#8221;. And they are absolutely right - if you feel confidence in something you do, you should not change the way you do it. <br />
</p><p>In another hand, I came to conclusion that it&#8217;s not dynamic types that makes me productive with JavaScript, but rather the experience I gathered with programming lately. It&#8217;s always only experience, that allows you to work faster, better quality and had fun of your job.<br />
<p>And it&#8217;s absolutely not about Static vs. Dynamic languages.<br />
</p><p>Static types are not useless, though. I think, in average it reduces the chances of bug introduction into the code. That&#8217;s at least what I&#8217;ve seen so far. And that&#8217;s why &#8220;purists&#8221; are running JSLint. Basically, Static Types should provide better application quality. This is of cause not completely true, since we know great software written in Python and poor systems written in C++.<br />
</p><p>It&#8217; about the engineers who build that software.<br />
</p><p>In my opinion the TypeScript will grow. It would have it&#8217;s own army of fans, like CoffeeScript have or Ruby have. The code that TypeScript outputs is nice and clean, that make easy of debugging it. TypeScript is designed to be closer to ECMAScript6 (Harmony), so in near future the pure JavaScript would start to look like TypeScript.<br />
</p><p>TypeScript is interesting project and open minded guys will like one. <br />

    <p>        Last weekend the good friends of mine were organizing great event, <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">CodeRetreat</a> in Odessa. I supposed to be there, but due to bad luck I missed that. Nevertheless, I was very interested in CodeRetreat idea, so I followed up the materials and learned a bit about it. <br />
    </p>    <p>        CodeRetreat is about the software craftsmanship. You focus on <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">4 principles of Simple Design</a>, work in pairs through the series of time boxed sessions, each time starting from scratch (yes, all code produced on previous sessions is destroyed with no mercy). All of that aim one simple goal, became a better developer. For the implementation they selected famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. The cellular automata, with simple rules but given very interesting results and foundation for numerous researches.<br />
    </p>    <p>        To do not stay with my misery of missing event, I decided to &#8220;play&#8221; game of life at home. Trying to follow the rules of sessions, I started to write some JavaScript code. It&#8217;s even hard to tell, how much fun I had during this implementation.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Tests, code, tests</h2>    <p>        TDD is very recommended way of development in CodeRetreats. I love TDD and fortunately the game of life is very TDD friendly. It&#8217;s all about the logic. Logic seems to be very simple and easy describe with tests. For my JavaScript testing I used to use <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> testing framework. Jasmine is BDD tests style, which was a little difficult to me at very beginning, but not I tend to write all my tests with BDD style.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I&#8217;ve spent first two sessions for idea elaboration. At the end third session, I got something working. As I said, the process of writing that code was so fun to me, that I even decided to <a href="https://gist.github.com/3763692">gist</a> the code I created so far. <br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bBm_BGTuy1I/UGQSj4MCYCI/AAAAAAAAJfk/m1aRicC5pYY/s622/image-2.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bBm_BGTuy1I/UGQSj4MCYCI/AAAAAAAAJfk/m1aRicC5pYY/s622/image-2.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        My big disappointment after was that code is actually not working.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>    <p>        Even if I had good tests suite, that showed my code works as expected the game was broken. And the issue is that I didn&#8217;t understand the domain good enough. It took me 4 sessions (about 4 hours) to finally understand the game.<br />
    </p>    <p>        I proved it once again for myself, there are no perfect code; the code you created at first time is probably broken (unless you understand the domain perfectly, but it&#8217;s rarely happen in reality). It&#8217;s OK to completely remove the code you created before and start from the beginning. And with each iteration you moving faster and faster.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HYIZR9Ssup4/UGQSj97MsoI/AAAAAAAAJfg/WZSrfAQcyd8/s622/image-3.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HYIZR9Ssup4/UGQSj97MsoI/AAAAAAAAJfg/WZSrfAQcyd8/s622/image-3.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        Knowing the requirements I was able to create good test suite. <br />
    </p>    <h2>Algorithms and data structures</h2>    <p>        During the implementation, you have to recall some basics algorithms and data structures. My initial implementation was based on usage of 2-dimensional arrays. It seems to be very natural fit, since the game is happening on orthogonal grid of square cells. But during the implementation of cell replication logic I suffered that design.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Index arithmetic is very tricky and error-prone stuff. So, after several tries I switched from array into the list of cells, each cell holds it&#8217;s state and position. The <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/gameoflife/blob/master/public/js/grid.js#L24">tick</a> method of became very elegant, containing 2-pass procedure - one to calculate next state of each state, second is to switch to new state.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JvlS1nI_Ay8/UGQSkXu3r-I/AAAAAAAAJfo/slOlEKrDXvo/s622/image-4.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JvlS1nI_Ay8/UGQSkXu3r-I/AAAAAAAAJfo/slOlEKrDXvo/s622/image-4.png" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        Again, I was so happy with code. It looked very readable as for me, without nested cycles and if-else statements.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Visualisation</h2>    <p>        You can really understand if something works or not, only if you see it in action. I had to have some UI to see, how game is actually working. <br />
    </p>    <p>        I&#8217;ve created very simple HTML based UI. The number of div&#8217;s which change it&#8217;s state, depending on cell state (alive or dead).<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ERo-PofMktc/UGQSjwS4NBI/AAAAAAAAJfc/bOOBADibPGk/s622/image-1.png"><br />
        <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ERo-PofMktc/UGQSjwS4NBI/AAAAAAAAJfc/bOOBADibPGk/s622/image-1.png" style="width: 620px" /><br />
    </a><br />
    <p>        The visualization of results is very important part. It&#8217;s only then I tried to run the game on 64x64 square, I realized that performance of my implementation is so terribly poor. It runs very slowly on Chrome, it makes IE10 die.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It means that, all beautiful code, tests, specs and so on - is almost useless, than it comes to performance. My 2-pass algorithm, with a simple implementation is not &#8220;production&#8221; ready, if we talk about some real software. Unit tests are usually done on smaller sets of data. Visualisation and trying the things on larger set of data opens up the reality.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        As I already said, it&#8217;s so much fun. It makes you feel like &#8220;back to roots&#8221;, forget about your enterprise stuff and do some real work. Besides it&#8217;s great TDD exercise. It&#8217;s probably to big to be called code kata, but it is still great for sharping an axe. Focusing on simple design is important. But making things &#8220;visible&#8221; and running them in real mode is vital. <br />
    </p>    <p>        The most important conclusion for me is: I&#8217;m still newbie developer, with so many areas to improve.<br />

<p>        Company Days is a yearly event in E-conomic, then all employees gather together. It&#8217;s usually happen in the middle of September, the time than Copenhagen is especially beautiful. It&#8217;s been great week, primarily because of opportunity to meet guys whom we work very close to. Besides the developers, primarily located in Denmark and Ukraine, business and operational people from UK, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Germany etc. are also coming, so it makes very cool international environment.<br />
    </p>    <p>        This year was a little special, since we had additional fun. Our CTO had organized the hackathon. The whole day event, supposed to create some valuable hacks for E-conomic product. All developers has been spitted on pairs and extended with business representatives. I had a team of 4 people - 2 developers and 2 business guys. Started at early morning near the blackboard, it was so nice to be part of process where the value is born in such extremely short period. We finally selected the idea, which seems to be very cool in terms of business and realistic in terms of one day implementation.<br />
    </p>    <p>        It&#8217;s been a long day of developing, debugging, demonstration and changes. Our product owners were always near us, giving both valuable feedback and supplying us with coffee and Danish chocolate sweets (that worked so good to me, since I needed sugar all the time). About 22.00 we got something that looks like a demo version of feature we wanted to produce. We&#8217;ve spent near 1 hour more, to show everything to PO&#8217;s and fix some small bugs. I felt very tired at the end.<br />
    </p>    <p>        Next day at 14.00 was big time of presentations. That was the funnies part. I have to admit, there was several really great hacks. In the same time some our PO&#8217;s are so cool of selling things that they turned the presentation into real show (kind of TV market, I would say). Everybody had a great joy, especially after words like &#8220;I&#8217;ve been asking for this feature for 2 year, and those guys created it in 16 hours&#8221;. It&#8217;s a bit of irony, but a bit of true as well. I know the jury that included CEO, CTO, Head of PO&#8217;s etc., we definitely happy to see the results and some hacks will be turned into the products really soon.<br />
    </p>    <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LsnSDGvzOrQ/UFsfQmfY5GI/AAAAAAAAJIQ/82qUi0631-A/s720/IMG_5365.JPG"><br />

    <p>        Apart from the hackathon, we had traditional speeches of CEO, Marketing people and guys from other departments. There was also a bit more activities, including jogging in which I took a part and did 8km distance. And of cause, Friday boat trip and party in restaurant. Party was so cool, that I almost missed my flight in the morning (but that&#8217;s a completely different story).<br />
    </p>    <p>        I would like to say thanks for everybody involved, I was happy to meet you guys once more.<br />

<p>My wife, Sasha is not (yet) IT person. Living with developer for 5 years, she knows only few details of developers job (like, they do code and sitting late nights to make it work). My bad, I never spent much time to explain what really my job is.<br />
</p><p>Recently she joined the training courses on software testing, to find the job in IT area in perspective.<br />
</p><p>After her second lesson she got back home and we had a talk about what she is actually studying there. It appeared they started with a software development processes, understanding how the software is actually created. So, they described waterfall (even if  nobody using it any more) and some agile frameworks (scrum of cause), and left with a homework, to read what else practices exists.<br />
</p><blockquote>- So, did you find anything interesting?<br />
- I read about few, but I think I found the most interesting one..<br />
- What&#8217;s that?<br />
- Its called Extreme Programming..<br />
- Hm, I never heard about it. Tell me more (trolls face on).<br />
- Alright, so it&#8217;s a different practices as Code review, Pair programming, Collective code ownership.. But you know, what&#8217;s the greatest one?<br />
- No, what&#8217;s that?<br />
- Its called Test Driven Development, or TDD.<br />
- What&#8217;s the point of this TDD? (troll face is still on).<br />
- Can you imagine that you create the test before you create any application code, make sure it doesn&#8217;t work and after you fix it, so you always sure that application works fine! That&#8217;s sound so interesting and so valuable, I can&#8217;t wait to try it!<br />
</blockquote><p>I had to put my troll face off, after that. I could not believe what I&#8217;m hearing. That was simply amazing!<br />
</p><blockquote>- Do you know, I&#8217;m a big TDD fan and the training courses I do from time to time are &#8220;TDD in .NET&#8221;, so we teach people of using TDD practices in real projects.<br />
- Fantastic, I never thought your job is so interesting!<br />
</blockquote><p>The big disappointment to her was that testers are not doing TDD (she though it&#8217;s actually the testers job). Nethertheless, I got one interesting thought.<br />
</p><p>During the trainings on TDD we try hard to explain people the value of TDD and usually there some guys who just deny the idea, seeing absolutely no value in it. That actually show some human feature called &#8220;open mindness&#8221;. <br />
</p><p>As less you know, as easy to you to get new ideas.. As much you know, as less agile your brain could be, as hard you can adopt anything new.With more experience you got, it&#8217;s harder and harder to adopt new things. This is only the matter of discipline and hard working to stay update and actually try things out. It&#8217;s also a big patience till some tool or technique became beneficial to you.<br />
</p><p>The point of my story is. Developer have to be open minded person during whole career. Something you did yesterday, may became obsolete tomorrow. There are many things outside your comfort zone you might missing, staying in comfort zone for long time.<br />
</p><p>Back to Sasha, I always knew she is very bright lady. Now I hope she became bright engineer, good luck to you, honey.<br />

    <p>        Even JavaScript language and front-end development has been much matured recent time, I still see a lot of confusion about usage of different frameworks and libraries.<br />
    </p>    <p>        For a half of year I use Backbone.js and feel much satisfied with it. It&#8217;s very popular library, probably because of personal popularity of the creator of Backbone.js <a href="http://en.twitter.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, very much known also as author of CoffeScript language.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Frameworks and libraries</h2>    <p>        There are differences between frameworks and libraries. In one sentence, &#8220;library is then you call some code, framework is then your code is called from somewhere&#8221;. The Backbone.js is clearly library. You usually have a lot of different options with libraries and less with frameworks. It&#8217;s very minimalistic, actually.<br />
    </p>    <p>        At core it only contains of only 4 components (Model, Collection, View, Router). This minimalism is both power and weak side of Backbone.js. The power is that you can build things whatever you like, Backbone fits the experience really smoothly. In the same time, you are really confused the time you just started, since you simply don&#8217;t understand how to make everything work together properly.<br />
    </p>    <h2>The essence of Backbone.js</h2>    <p>        In one of the podcasts with Jeremy, he said &#8220;Backbone is something that almost every developer will come to theirselves.. dealing with JavaScript applications for a while&#8221;. I could not agree more. If you have previous experience in programming and you see the value of architecture and design, you will definitely start to invent something similar to Backbone.<br />
    </p>    <p>        After some time spend of development jQuery based application you will realize many fundamental issues, like: data does not belong to DOM, events are not limited on jQuery and so on. But the main issue is jQuery apps usually violates the &#8220;Single Responsibility Principle&#8221;, mixing and manipulation with data and views in the same time. Experienced developers, tries to eliminate SRP issues as soon as possible, almost naturally coming to MVC pattern.<br />
    </p>    <p>        In essence the Backbone is a way to structure you application better. It makes clear de-coupling between data and views that render that data. It&#8217;s nothing more than that.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Abstracting things out</h2>    <p>        Programming is a matter of abstractions. As better abstractions you have as better code you have. <br />
    </p>    <p>        Every application works with data. The data does not appear in browser just like that, it have to fetched from somewhere. It&#8217;s also have to be persisted somewhere. The data could be changed and you have to validate that change is right. If some part of data is changing, you want to be notified on that change. Notice that, this is a very common functionality you want to keep between all data classes - initialization, validation, persistence. This is where the <code>Backbone.Model</code> comes out. With <code>Backbone.Model</code> all that things are already &#8220;in the box&#8221; you just need to apply your own strategies of implementation.<br />
    </p>    <p>        You typically don&#8217;t deal with one instance of model. REST interfaces are usually expose something like <code>/api/tasks</code> or <code>/api/photos</code> and so on. You need to group the models into collections. Collection (similar to model) are able fetch and persist itself, all it needs to know is the actual type of Model and URL. This is where <code>Backbone.Collection</code> shies. You are keeping all models close together, if some model become destroyed the collection will be updated, so it always in consistent state.<br />
    </p>    <p>        With view is basically render your models as DOM structure. So, the <code>Backbone.View</code> is abstraction with primarily method - <code>render</code>. Backbone does not say, how exactly you are going to do that. You can create handcrafted HTML and append it DOM, or use some templating mechanisms. Instead, it provides you convenient methods for listening to view events (like clicks, focusout or any other DOM supported events). Inside the handlers you either could update related model or apply some changes to view parts, whatever.<br />
    </p>    <p>        And finally <code>Backbone.Router</code> is a facility to building, so called Single Page Applications (SPA). SPA&#8217;s most popular example is GMail. You browsing emails, writing and sending - without and page reloads. What&#8217;s changing is only hash part of URL (like #inbox, #sent, #all). Router is handling hash change events and triggers registered handler. Inside the handler, you can initialize the corresponding application.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Don&#8217;t repeat yourself</h2>    <p>        Now, please let me know. How many times did you create (read copy-n-paste) the code for RESTful data persistence? How many times, you did you create code for validation? How many hours you spend for looking for some event listener provoking the bug in your app and hiding somewhere among 200 .js files?<br />
    </p>    <p>        If your answer, more that 2 - stop doing that. Don&#8217;t repeat yourself - reuse. And better - reuse from best.<br />
    </p>    <h2>Conclusions</h2>    <p>        There are great solutions, created by people experienced than me, amplified by huge community behind. <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone">Backbone.js</a> is one best representatives of such solutions. Having a something that I could rely on, that works good and there <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backbone.js">places</a> to get help is very strong reason for me, to keep doing that, instead of re-invent wheel yet another time.<br />
