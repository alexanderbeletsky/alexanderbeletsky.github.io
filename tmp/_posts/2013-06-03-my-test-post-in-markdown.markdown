Here we go with some test. Some another text.

Trying *italic* or **strong** texts. I hope it works fine.. Next lines you won't see.

<!-- more -->

## Here we go with heading

And paragraph of text. More interesting stuff, code!

```
$ jitsu deploy
```

And some javascript

```js
var f = function () {
	console.log('hello world');
}
```

and some html,

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
</head>
<body></body>
```

Code with tab

	var x = 10;

	public class A {
		public void foo () {

		}
	}

## Another paragraph

Text, text text

Trying to use `code snip` inline.
