<div class='post'>
<p>        I dedicated some time for that and happy to announce - ELMAH MVC controller released         on NuGet.     </p><p>        Due to the latest interest, feedback and changes - it has no sense         at all to keep that code just in blog post. In my <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/08/latest-version-of-elmah-mvc-controller.html">previous</a> post I promised to create NuGet package for that, so here we are:     </p><div class="commandWrapper">        <div class="commandPrompt">            <p class="command">                PM&gt; Install-Package Elmah.MVC</p></div></div><p>        I simplified code even a little more to avoid changing in routes (in case of Admin area already exists in project).     </p><p>        So just grab it from NuGet now.     </p></div>
