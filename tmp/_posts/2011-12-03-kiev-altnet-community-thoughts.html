<p>I've just reviewed blog posts I created thought that year and realized that I miss very important piece of information here. Something that literally changed my developers life. And I'm talking about <a href="http://kievalt.net/">Kiev ALT.NET</a> community.<br />
</p><p>From my first join at the beginning of the year I amazed with very cool and friendly atmosphere there. I tried to visit every meeting and each of them brought some value for me. And the most valuable asset I got there is people I met. Those guys simply rock.<br />

</a><br />
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/chaliy">Mike Chaliy</a>, the leader of community does exceptional job. I could imagine how hard could it be to do all organization work and he does that very well. <br />
</p><p>What's important, Mike involved me to do my own speech. I remember that first time when I was sharing my experience with <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2011/05/continuous-production-make-it-work.html">Continues Deployment</a> based on Chuck Norris tools and Jenkins. That was a good start and I did several more speeches after. I would say it happened only because of Kiev ALT.NET.<br />
</p><p>Getting of knowledge for me is not only books, podcasts and just coding practice. But also, discussions, questions and speeches. I this is definitely productive way of learning. <br />
</p><p>So, I'm very thankful to Kiev ALT.NET for that positive feel of progress, pleasure of communication with smart guys and fun time of after parties.I wish a long life for community and try to help it as much as I can.<br />
