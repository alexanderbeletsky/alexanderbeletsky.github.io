<p>Some time ago I was taking part into <a href="http://abeletsky.blogspot.com/2010/06/architectural-design-challenge-by-james.html">design challange</a> by James Shore. One of participants <a href="http://agilitateur.azeau.com/">Par Oaz</a> did his own analisys of all submitted solutions. He did a very nice job putting his effort on this, it was really interesting to check it out.</p>
