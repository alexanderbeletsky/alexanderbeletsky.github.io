It might be well known fact, but I just discovered it to myself. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> has a nice feature together with Chrome. If you looking for some information, just start typing stackoverflow.com in Chrome URL bar, as soon as Chrome will suggest you to use http://stackoveflow.com press tab and you will see a prompt to put your query. Just create your query and press enter and you will get results directly from StackOverflow site. It seems a very nice and useful feature, since I frequently use StackOverflow as source of information.
