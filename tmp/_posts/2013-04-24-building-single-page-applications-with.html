<div class='post'>
    <p>This Saturday I was doing my first Backbone.js class. It went really fine, except one fact.<br />
</p><p>I wanted to show the aspects of creating Single Pages Application running on Backbone. Started the application from scratch, we had to spend a lot of time writing some infrastructure code before we even jump to Backbone. So, after the class I decided to create some boilerplate project, so next time we would just clone it from github and start to work.<br />
<!-- more -->
</p><p>That's how the <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone-express-spa">backbone-express-spa</a> born.<br />
</p><h2>Backbone.js + Express.js SPA boilerplate</h2><p>The project is a <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> application using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> as front-end framework. The idea is you just simply clone it, remove non needed routes and application and build something on your own.<br />
</p><p>I won't put to much details in a blog post, since <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone-express-spa">repo</a> neat readme section. Just several facts:<br />
</p><ul><li><strong>Minimal and simple</strong> - pure Backbone code, no plugins. For some real needs plugins are required anyway and you are free to include whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>AMD modules with RequireJS</strong> - modularity is key factor for large-scale apps, <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a></li>
<li><strong>Concept of Application</strong> - to group all view, models, collection related to one application unit in one place.</li>
<li><strong>Handlebars template</strong> - using <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> as template engine.</li>
</ul><h2>Further work</h2><p>It's not yet completely done. I want to create more meaningful app, show some layouts principles + prepare readme section of building application for production.<br />
</p><p>I'm also thinking of putting some examples of unit tests both for Express.js and Backbone.js.<br />
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone-express-spa">backbone-express-spa</a> out. If you like it, please give some stars or shout in twitter. I would be really happy to see some pull requests for improving applications or infrastructure. So, if you want to join - you are welcome!<br />
