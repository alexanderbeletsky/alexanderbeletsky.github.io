<p>
I'm not doing blogging for a long time, event if I started on march of 2008 I had a great pause in it. Originally I started a blog in Russian, but later I've decided to switch to English, mainly because I wanted to my colleagues from Denmark to read my blog.. and probably got bit wider audience.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.problogger.net/">Problogger.net</a> is a great place for bloggers. Even if you don't plan to get money from your blog (as me) there are great number of tips/tricks for bloggers, as well as some inspiring information. I've started to read it recently I found it very interesting.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/01/06/about-darren/">Daren Rowse</a> is a man behing Problogger.net, professional blogger who live in Melbourne, Australia. He announced <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/07/16/take-the-7-link-challenge-today/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ProbloggerHelpingBloggersEarnMoney+(ProBlogger:+Helping+Bloggers+Earn+Money)">7 Links challenge</a>. I also decided to pick it up. Here we go:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>First post - </b><a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2008/03/blog-post.html">Первое сообщение</a> it was a small introduction of myself to the world, as well as setting up objectives for this blog. It was in Russian, so what I said there is that I going to write about challenges that I met in my development course everyday, to keep and share the knowledge I got. I still doing that.. I think.</li>
<li><b>The post I enjoyed writing the most -</b> I have a lot of fun during my blogging (even if sometimes it is hard to finish up some post) I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/07/github-social-coding.html">GitHub Social coding</a> the most. It was my first, not so technical, with elements of philosophy post.. I liked that!</li>
<li>
<b>A post which had a great discussion - </b> I haven't created a post that really attracted big attention and discussion. I'm OK with that, I still think 
    I create one. 
</li>
<li><b>A post  on someone else’s blog that you wish you’d written -</b> This is the one that <a href="http://disqus.com/shmonder/">Anton Litvinenko</a> created recently, called <a href="http://blog.devpulse.com/post/871510417/the-biggest-demotivator-for-programmer">The biggest demotivator for programmer</a>. Nicely written and describing very actual things for every developer. It is not only me, who liked that it was in top of dzone.com for several days.</li>
<li><b>A post with a title I am proud of - </b> Hard to say may be <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/07/no-back-up-fail.html">No back up... Fail!</a>. Don't know why, but I liked the most.</li>
<li>
<b>A post that you wish more people had read -</b> It might be the set of my first blog posts, related to TDD. I've tried to describe my vision of TDD and why I like it. It was in Russian and my first bloggin experience.. but anyway <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2008/03/1.html">Разработка ведомая тестированием. Часть 1. Описание</a>. And also I tried to find some ideas in <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/07/blogging-with-github-and-blogspot-ideas.html">Blogging with a GitHub and Blogspot? Ideas?</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>My most helpful/visited post -</b> so far it is <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/06/ddd-implementation-of-repository.html">DDD, Implementation of Repository pattern with Linq to SQL</a> that I created after discussion of Repositories on <a href="http://forums.asp.net/">asp.net forum</a> that I try to read/write periodically.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
